"@thirdweb-dev/payments": major
---

The `@thirdweb-dev/payments` package is a continuation of the `@paperxyz/js-client-sdk`, aligning with the new branding and expanded capabilities under thirdweb. It inherits the core functionality of Paper's developer-first NFT checkout solution.

### Changed

- Rebranded package from `@paperxyz/js-client-sdk` to `@thirdweb-dev/payments`. Users of the old package should migrate to this new package name.

- Changed PaperSdkError typename to PaymentsSdkError
