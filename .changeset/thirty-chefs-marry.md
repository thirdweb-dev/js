Migrated `@paperxyz/react-client-sdk` into `@thirdweb-dev/react` to provide checkout components under the thirdweb react sdk. The `@paperxyz/react-client-sdk` package will be continued within the `@thirdweb-dev/react` package, aligning with the new branding and expanded capabilities under thirdweb. It inherits the core functionality and components of Paper's developer-first NFT checkout solution.

### Added

- Integrated the `@paper-xyz/react-client-sdk` components into `@thirdweb-dev/react`. This update brings all the Paper.xyz React components into the thirdweb ecosystem, providing a seamless developer experience for building NFT-powered applications.
- New components from Paper.xyz for NFT checkouts, enhancing the existing thirdweb SDK capabilities.
