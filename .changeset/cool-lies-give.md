**Dropped Support for Solana**:

- We've decided to drop support for Solana across our SDKs.
- Starting with this version of our SDKs all previous solana related functionality will be removed.
- Previous versions of our SDKs will continue to work with Solana. However, we will not be providing any further updates or bug fixes for Solana.
- You can read a detailed explanation of our decision [on our blog](https://blog.thirdweb.com/discontinuing-solana-support/).
