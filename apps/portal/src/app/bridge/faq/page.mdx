# Bridge FAQs

### General

<Details summary="What does Bridge use to operate under the hood?">
Bridge is an asset router that combines thirdweb's own onchain infrastructure with existing bridging and swapping protocols to find the optimal route for any given transaction. This can include intents, native bridges, third party bridges, cross-chain messaging protocols, thirdweb's custom bridges, and more. All routes are monitored and planned continuously for health, price, and speed to guarantee the best path every time.
