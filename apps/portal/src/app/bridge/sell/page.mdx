# Sell a Specific Amount of Tokens

You can create a payment with either the input amount (sell) or output amount (buy) of a token. Most examples focus on buying a specific amount, but you can just as easily sell a specific amount of tokens.


### Generate a sell payment

To generate a sale, use the same inputs as `Buy.prepare`, but with the `Sell.prepare` function. The following function will sell 50 USDT on Arbitrum. The returned `destinationAmount` will indicate how much USDC on Optimism you'll receive after fees.

```typescript
import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

const preparedQuote = await Bridge.Sell.prepare({
originChainId: 42161,
originTokenAddress: "0xFd086bC7CD5C481DCC9C85ebE478A1C0b69FCbb9", // USDT on Arbitrum
destinationChainId: 10,
destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // USDC on Optimism
amount: 50_000_000n, // 50 USDT in wei (USDT has 6 decimals)
sender: "0x2a4f24F935Eb178e3e7BA9B53A5Ee6d8407C0709",
receiver: "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045",
client,
});
```

You can execute this quote exactly like a buy. See the [Send a Payment](/payments/send) guide for more details on this process.
