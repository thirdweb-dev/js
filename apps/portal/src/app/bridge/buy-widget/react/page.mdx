# Buy widget component

The Buy widget component makes it easy for users to purchase crypto tokens in your app

## Features

- Purchase crypto tokens with fiat (credit/debit cards)
- Cross-chain token swaps across 90+ blockchains
- Display product information (title, description, image)
- Customizable UI with dark and light mode support
- Display fiat values in multiple currencies

## Example

You will need a thirdweb project client id to use the `BuyWidget` component. You can get your clientId by creating a project in the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team).

```tsx
import { BuyWidget } from "thirdweb/react";
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { base } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: "YOUR_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID",
});

function Example() {
  return (
    <BuyWidget
      client={client}
      chain={base}
      amount="0.01"
    />
  );
}
```

Make sure to wrap the component containing `BuyWidget` with the `ThirdwebProvider` component.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <YourApp />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

### Prefill a specific token

You can prefill the widget with a specific token by passing the `tokenAddress` prop.

```tsx
import { BuyWidget } from "thirdweb/react";
import { base } from "thirdweb/chains";

function Example() {
  return (
    <BuyWidget
      client={client}
      chain={base}
      // USDC on Base
      tokenAddress="0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
      amount="10"
    />
  );
}
```

### Send to a specific address

By default, the connected wallet address receives the purchased tokens.

You can set `receiverAddress` prop to send the purchased tokens to a different address.

```tsx
import { BuyWidget } from "thirdweb/react";
import { base } from "thirdweb/chains";

function Example() {
  return (
    <BuyWidget
      client={client}
      chain={base}
      amount="0.01"
      receiverAddress="0x123...abc"
    />
  );
}
```
