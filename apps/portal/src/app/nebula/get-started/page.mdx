# Get Started

Learn how to get set up and started with the Nebula API to successfully prepare and enable a connected user to sign a transfer .

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- A thirdweb account 
- A blockchain wallet for executing transactions
- Node.js and npm or yarn installed on your system

## Obtain Client ID & Secret Key

<Steps>

<Step title="Create project">

Navigate to the [projects dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/) and create a new project.

<DocImage src={NewProject} alt="Create a new project"/>
  
</Step>

<Step title="Obtain keys">

Setup your project and obtain your client ID and secret key. Please note your secret key somewhere safe as it is not recoverable.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Client Id vs Secret Key">
Client Id is used for client side usage and is restricted by the domain restrictions you set on your API key, it is a public identifier which can be used on the frontend safely.

Secret key is used for server side or script usage and is not restricted by the domain restrictions. Never expose your secret key in client side code.
</Callout>

</Step>

</Steps>

## Setup API (TypeScript SDK)

<Steps>

<Step title="Install SDK">

Install the TypeScript SDK

```bash
npm install thirdweb
```
</Step>

<Step title="Environment Variables">

Setup environmental variables. 

<Callout variant="warning" title="Storing Secret Keys">
  Ensure you keep your secret key safe and do not expose it in your codebase. We recommend using a 
  secret key manager such as [AWS Secret Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) or [Google Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager).
</Callout>

```jsx
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_thirdweb_secret_key
```
</Step>

<Step title="Import Libraries">

Import required libraries from thirdweb.

```jsx
import {
    createThirdwebClient,
  prepareTransaction,
  sendTransaction,
  privateKeyToAccount,
} from "thirdweb";
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create Function to Handle Response">
This function processes the API's response and executes blockchain transactions.

```jsx
import { generateAccount } from "thirdweb/wallets";

async function handleNebulaResponse(response) {
  const client = createThirdwebClient({
    secretKey: process.env.THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY,
  });

  // You can use any wallet- see https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/supported-wallets
  const account = await generateAccount({ client });

  if (response.actions && response.actions.length > 0) {
    const action = response.actions[0];
    const txData = JSON.parse(action.data);

    try {
      const transaction = prepareTransaction({
        to: txData.to,
        data: txData.data,
        value: BigInt(txData.value),
        chain: txData.chainId,
        client,
      });

      const result = await sendTransaction({
        transaction,
        account,
      });

      console.log("Transaction Successful:", result);
      return result;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error executing transaction:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step title="Call Nebula API">

Send a request to the Nebula API to interpret your natural language command and retrieve the transaction details.

```jsx
const response = await fetch("https://nebula-api.thirdweb.com/chat", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-secret-key": process.env.THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: "send 0.001 ETH on Sepolia to vitalik.eth",
    execute_config: {
      mode: "client",
      signer_wallet_address: "0xYourWalletAddress",
    },
  }),
});

const data = await response.json();
await handleNebulaResponse(data);
```
</Step>

<Step title="Example Response">

The response from the API will contain the transaction details.

```jsx
Transaction Successful: {
  transactionHash: "0x123abc...",
  blockNumber: 1234567,
  ...
}
```
</Step>

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the Nebula API and executed a transaction using the thirdweb SDK.
