# Get Started

Learn how to get started with the thirdweb MCP server.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- uv

### Run with uvx
```bash
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=... \
    uvx thirdweb-mcp
```

### Install and run with pipx

```bash
pipx install thirdweb-mcp

THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=... \
    thirdweb-mcp
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/ai.git thirdweb-ai
cd thirdweb-ai/python/thirdweb-mcp
uv sync
```

## Configuration

The thirdweb MCP server requires configuration based on which services you want to enable:

1. **thirdweb Secret Key**: Required for Nebula and Insight services. Obtain from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
2. **Chain IDs**: Blockchain network IDs to connect to (e.g., 1 for Ethereum mainnet, 137 for Polygon).
3. **Engine Configuration**: If using the Engine service, you'll need the Engine URL and authentication JWT.

You can provide these through command-line options or environment variables.

## Usage

### Command-line options

```bash
# Basic usage with default settings (stdio transport with Nebula and Insight)
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=... thirdweb-mcp 

# Using SSE transport on a custom port
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=... thirdweb-mcp --transport sse --port 8080

# Enabling all services with specific chain IDs
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=... thirdweb-mcp --chain-id 1 --chain-id 137 \
    --engine-url YOUR_ENGINE_URL \
    --engine-auth-jwt YOUR_ENGINE_JWT \ 
    --engine-backend-wallet-address YOUR_ENGINE_BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Environment variables

You can also configure the MCP server using environment variables:

- `THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY`: Your thirdweb API secret key
- `THIRDWEB_ENGINE_URL`: URL endpoint for thirdweb Engine service
- `THIRDWEB_ENGINE_AUTH_JWT`: Authentication JWT token for Engine
- `THIRDWEB_ENGINE_BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS`: Wallet address for Engine backend
