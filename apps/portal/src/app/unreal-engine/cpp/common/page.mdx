## Enums

### **EFunctionResult**
Represents the result of a generic function call.
- `Success`: The operation completed successfully.
- `Failed`: The operation failed.

### **ESmartWalletDeployedFunctionResult**
Represents the deployment status of a smart wallet.
- `Deployed`: The smart wallet is deployed.
- `NotDeployed`: The smart wallet is not deployed.
- `Failed`: The check for deployment status failed.

### **EOTPVerificationFunctionResult**
Represents the result of an OTP (One-Time Password) verification.
- `Verified`: The OTP was successfully verified.
- `Retry`: The OTP verification failed, but can be retried.
- `Failed`: The OTP verification failed with no retry available.

### **EThirdwebOAuthProvider**
- Represents the supported OAuth providers.
- `Google`: Represents Google as an OAuth provider.
- `Apple`: Represents Apple as an OAuth provider.
- `Facebook`: Represents Facebook as an OAuth provider.
- `Discord`: Represents Discord as an OAuth Provider.
- `Farcaster`: Represents Farcaster as an OAuth Provider.
- `Telegram`: Represents Telegram as an OAuth Provider.
- `Line`: Represents Line as an OAuth Provider.
- `X`: Represents X as an OAuth Provider.
- `Coinbase`: Represents Coinbase as an OAuth Provider.

### **EThirdwebOTPMethod**
- Represents the supported OTP authentication methods.

## Structs

### FSigner

`FSigner` represents a signer in the context of a smart wallet within the Thirdweb SDK. The signer is responsible for
signing transactions and managing the approval of targets and limits on native tokens.

#### Properties
- `Address`: The Ethereum address of the signer.
- `ApprovedTargets`: An array of approved contract addresses that the signer is allowed to interact with.
- `NativeTokenLimitPerTransaction`: The limit of native tokens (e.g. ETH) that can be spent per transaction.
- `StartTime`: The start time for the signer's permissions, specified as a `FDateTime`.
- `EndTime`: The end time for the signer's permissions, specified as a `FDateTime`.

#### Class Functions
- `FromJson(JsonObject)`: create an `FSigner` instance from a JSON object.
