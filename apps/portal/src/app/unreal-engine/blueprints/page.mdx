# Blueprint Overview

All blueprint facing nodes are contained within the `UThirdwebFunctionLibrary` class. It provides a comprehensive set of
Blueprint functions to interact with Thirdweb's wallet functionalities within Unreal Engine. This includes utilities
for wallet creation, session management, signing messages, and more.

## Internal Implementation Notes

- The `BP_` function prefix is an unreal engine standard designed to ensure c++ developers do not use functions intended
  for blueprint use
- The `Conv_` function prefix is an unreal engine required convention to detect autocast nodes
- All operator function prefixes are an unreal engine convention required to detect standard operator node wildcards
