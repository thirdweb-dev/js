# MCP server

You can use the thirdweb MCP server to interact with the thirdweb API from your agents or LLM client.

### Remote MCP endpoint

You can access the MCP server at the following url, with your project secret key.

```http
# endpoint
POST /mcp
Host: api.thirdweb.com

# auth header (required)
x-secret-key <your-project-secret-key>
```

### Usage with LLM clients

You can also use the MCP server on your own LLM client, like cursor, claude code and more. Refer to your LLM client's documentation for more information.

#### Example usage with Cursor:

Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "thirdweb-api": {
      "url": "https://api.thirdweb.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-secret-key": "<your-project-secret-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with agents

Use your favorite agent framework to plug in the MCP server as a collection of tools for your agent.  Refer to your agent framework's documentation for more information.

#### Example usage with langchain:

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

client = MultiServerMCPClient(
    {
        "thirdweb-api": {
            "transport": "streamable_http",
            "url": "https://api.thirdweb.com/mcp",
            "headers": {
                "x-secret-key": "<your-project-secret-key>"
            },
        }
    }
)
tools = await client.get_tools()
agent = create_react_agent("openai:gpt-4.1", tools)
response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "create a server wallet called 'my-wallet'"})
```
