# Ecosystem Wallet Explorer Page

Every Ecosystem Wallet deployment will also create a wallet management page that you can share with your partners and users. End users can visit this page to view tokens and assets in the in-app wallets theyâ€™ve created across your ecosystem.

Once you deploy, we will automatically generate and host this page for you. We will provide you with a URL that you can share with your ecosystem partners and end users. You'll be able to find your explorer URL in the Wallet Explorer tab of the [Ecosystem Wallet dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/ecosystem).
