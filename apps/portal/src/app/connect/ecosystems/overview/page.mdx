# Ecosystem Wallet

An ecosystem wallet is your own managed in-app wallet service that allows you to create a branded wallet and login system, and allow any number of partners to spin up in-app wallets. End users that create in-app wallets in your partner applications (either with email, phone number, passkey, or socials) will receive one account and wallet address that they can access across all apps and games in your ecosystem.
