# Pregenerate User Wallets

To pregenerate an embedded wallet, you can make a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

```
https://embedded-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/v1/pregenerate
```

### Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following parameters:

- `strategy`: The strategy for wallet generation (currently supports "email")
- `email`: The email address associated with the wallet to be generated

### Headers

You need to include the following headers:

- `x-ecosystem-id`: Your ecosystem ID
- `x-secret-key`: Your secret key for authentication
- `Content-Type`: Must be set to `application/json`

### Example curl Command

Here's an example curl command to pregenerate an embedded wallet:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://embedded-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/v1/pregenerate' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-id: ecosystem.example-eco-123' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: 9f8e7d6c5b4a3f2e1d0c9b8a7ffge434b2a1f0e9d8c7b6a5f4e3d2c1b0a9f8e7' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "strategy": "email",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }'
```

Replace the header values with your actual client ID, ecosystem ID, and secret key.

### Response Format

The API returns a JSON object. The exact structure may vary based on the implementation, but it typically includes information about the pregenerated wallet. Here's a possible structure:

```json
{
  "wallet": {
      "address": "string",
      "createdAt": "string",
  }
}
```

Note: The actual response may include additional fields or have a different structure. Please refer to the most up-to-date documentation for the exact response format.

Remember to handle the response appropriately in your chosen programming language, including error cases and parsing the JSON response.
