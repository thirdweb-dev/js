# Deploying Your App to Production

Before you deploy your app to real users, you'll want to make sure your application is secure and ready to onboard users to your app. This involves separating some operations to the server and others to the client.

The examples in [Getting Started](/connect/auth) do everything on the client. The following examples demonstrate what should be on the server instead to ensure your application is secure.

<Callout variant="info">
	Some of the code here is left for you to implement. This provides you with
	flexibility and control over your application's authentication. However, if
	you'd like specific examples, check out our
	[templates](/connect/auth#templates) or [framework
	guides](/connect/auth#frameworks).
</Callout>

<Tabs defaultValue="client">

<TabsList>
	<TabsTrigger value="client">Client</TabsTrigger>
	<TabsTrigger value="server">Server</TabsTrigger>
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="client">

At the root of your application:

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

export default function App() {
	return <ThirdwebProvider>{/* Your app here */}</ThirdwebProvider>;
}
```

In your `components` directory:

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });

export default function Connect() {
	<ConnectButton
		client={client}
		auth={{
			getLoginPayload: async (params) => {
				const address = params.address;
				// fetch the login payload here using address
			},
			doLogin: async (params) => {
				// send the signed login payload (params) to the server
			},
			isLoggedIn: async () => {
				// fetch the user's login status from the server
			},
			doLogout: async () => {
				// send a logout request to the server
			},
		}}
	/>;
}
```

</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="server">

```ts
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { createAuth } from "thirdweb/auth";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
	clientId: "1234567890", // get yours at https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys
});

const thirdwebAuth = createAuth({
	domain: "localhost:3000",
	client,
});

// 1. generate a login payload
const loginPayload = await auth.generatePayload({ address: "0x123..." });

// 2. sign the login payload
const signature = await auth.signPayload({
	payload: loginPayload,
	account: userAccount,
});

// 3. verify the login payload and signature that the client sends back later
const verifiedPayload = await auth.verifyPayload({
	payload: loginPayload,
	signature,
});

// 4. generate a JWT for the client
const jwt = await auth.generateJWT({ payload: verifiedPayload });

// 5. set the JWT as a cookie or store it another way

// 6. authenticate the client based on the JWT on subsequent calls
const { valid, parsedJWT } = await auth.verifyJWT({ jwt });
```
