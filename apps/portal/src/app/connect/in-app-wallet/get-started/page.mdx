# QuickStart

Once set up, your app will be able to connect and create in-app wallets for users.

## Try the demo

See In-App Wallets in action with our demo app:

<OpenSourceCard
	title="CatAttack"
	description="In-App Wallet Demo App"
	href="https://catattack.thirdweb.com"
/>

## Starting from a template

Quickly get started with one of our templates:

<OpenSourceCard
	title="In-app wallets with gasless transactions (account abstraction)"
	description="A starter kit for building in-app wallets with smart contract integrations."
	href="https://github.com/thirdweb-example/embedded-smart-wallet"
	tag="v4 SDK"
/>

## Starting from existing project

Install the required package:

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn add thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
	bun="bun i thirdweb"
/>

## Get your client ID

To use in-app wallets in your applications, you will need a client ID. You can get one for free on [your thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

## Connecting & Creating In-App Wallets
