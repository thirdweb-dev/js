# Overview

In-App wallets already support most popular login methods out of the box, but we also give app developers the flexibility to use
in-app wallets with any authentication method. If you have a valid authenticated user, you should be able to easily spin up an
in-app wallet for them irrespective of how they got authenticated.

This means that app developers can now

- **Spin up in-app wallets for users using an existing authentication service**. For example, if you have a game where players log in using their username and password, you can now easily create wallets when they sign up.
- **Integrate with any social login provider**. For example, if you have a game where you want to let users login with their Steam or Epic games credentials, you can now use in-app wallets to enable these experiences.
- **Use in-app wallets in non-frontend environments**. For example, you could authenticate users with SSH and use in-app wallets with CLI tools.
- **Build completely custom authentication experiences**. For example, you could ask users to verify their credentials with 2FA or passkey before you consider them authenticated and provision wallets for them.
