# Custom Auth Server

Learn how to integrate your auth backend with our in-app wallets solution so you can onboard your users into web3 seamlessly.

This guide will show you how to create your own Auth Server that is compatible with the `auth_endpoint` strategy. By doing so, you can have full control over user authentication and data security. This allows you to ensure that your application meets specific compliance requirements while also providing a customized sign-in experience.

<Callout variant="warning" title="Security">
	This guide is simplified for demonstration purposes and is not ready for
	production use. When modifying it for production, secure your endpoints and
	avoid hard-coding secrets or sensitive information. We recommend using
	environment variables and secret managers.
</Callout>

## 5 minute quickstart

<Steps>

<Step title="Step 1">
	Navigate to Wallets > [In-App
	Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded) in the thirdweb
	dashboard.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 2">
	Create a thirdweb API key if you don't have one or select an existing key to
	use for this project. [Learn more about API
	keys.](/api-keys)

<DocImage src={EWCreateKey} />

</Step>

<Step title="Step 3">
	Allowlist domain or bundle IDs in Access Restrictions.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 4">
	Navigate to the Configuration view and enable **Custom Auth Endpoint**

    <DocImage src={EWCustomAuthConfig} />

</Step>

<Step title="Step 5">
	Set the Auth Endpoint URL to
	`https://embedded-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/2023-11-30/embedded-wallet/auth/test-custom-auth-endpoint`
	for testing purposes. You will replace this later with your own auth server
	endpoint to verify the `payload`.
</Step>

<Step title="Step 6">Save the configuration.</Step>

<Step title="Step 7">Copy the client ID.</Step>

<Step title="Step 8">
	In your preferred thirdweb client SDK, pass the payload you retrieved from
	logging in to the server.
</Step>

</Steps>

You can now auth into the wallet and use it to sign transactions like so (see [use your own auth for more](/in-app-wallet/custom-auth)):

		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		wallet.connect({

			strategy: "auth_endpoint",
			payload: JSON.stringify({ userId: "ANY_RANDOM_ID_HERE" }),
			encryptionKey: "your-encryption-key",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

```typescript
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = inAppWallet();

const account = await wallet.connect({
	client,
	strategy: "auth_endpoint",
	payload: JSON.stringify({ userId: "ANY_RANDOM_ID_HERE" }),
	encryptionKey: "your-encryption-key",
});

// use the account to send transactions
```

</TabsContent>
</Tabs>

You can set your encryptionKey in either a secret env variable or ask the user to enter a password for it.

** Do not hardcode the encryptionKey in your code. **

A persistent, cross-platform wallet is now created for your user!

Of course, you would use your own auth server instead of the one we provided. The rest of this guide will show you how to create your own auth server.

### Setup

The following steps will show you how to create a simple auth server that can be used with the embedded wallet.

At a high level, the auth server will:

1. Handle login for the user into your application.
2. Have a way to get a public identifier for the user.
3. Have an endpoint to verify the public identifier and return some basic information about the user

Steps 1 and 2 are up to you to implement. You can use any auth strategy you want.

The endpoint in step 3 is what you register as your auth endpoint on the thirdweb dashboard.

Here's a high-level diagram:

<DocImage src={EWCustomAuthFlow} />

<Steps>

<Step title="Step 1">

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your CLI

```bash
mkdir custom-auth-server
cd custom-auth-server
```

</Step>

<Step title="Step 2">

Initialize a new Node.js application

```bash
npm init -y
```

OR

```bash
yarn init -y
```

</Step>

</Steps>

### **Create the Server:**

In the `custom-auth-server` directory, create a file at the root named `server.js` and paste the following:

```jsx
const express = require("express");
const fs = require("fs");

const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

const users = [{ id: 1, email: "user@example.com", password: "password123" }];

app.use(express.json());

// This is what your app calls to log in a user and get a public identifier for the user (otherwise known as the payload)
app.post("/login", (req, res) => {
	const { email, password } = req.body;
	const user = users.find((u) => u.email === email && u.password === password);
	if (!user) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

	res.send({ payload: user.id });
});

// This is a sample endpoint that you would register on the thirdweb dashboard for us to verify the payload
app.post("/thirdweb-will-call-this", (req, res) => {
	const { payload } = req.body;
	if (!payload) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

	// You would write your own logic here to verify the payload here
	const user = users.find((u) => u.id === payload);
	if (!user) return res.status(401).send({ message: "Invalid credentials" });

	// Once the user is successfully verified, you can return the following field
	return res.send({
		userId: user.id,
		// The last two fields here are optional
		email: user.email,
		exp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 60 * 24 * 30,
	});
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
	console.log(`Server started on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

### **Test Locally**

1. Start the server:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Test login:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
   ```

### **Deploy**

To deploy the server, you can use services such as [Zeet](https://zeet.co/) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

### **Integrate In-App Wallets**

Refer top the [quickstart above](#5-minute-quickstart) to integrate the embedded wallet into your application.
