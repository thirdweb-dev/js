# Integrate Firebase Auth

Learn how to obtain a JSON Web Token (JWT) from Firebase using Firebase's email provider and integrate it with In-App Wallet.

<Callout title="Info" variant="info">

This article covers the steps of integrating Firebase Auth for a React Native app. Firebase steps and the In-App Wallet code may be replicated for React.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

- Firebase project
- React App

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a React Native App">
Create a react native app with the tool of your choice and install the required packages:

```shell
npm i thirdweb
```

2. Note that we assume this is a simple app with a single screen `App.tsx`.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up your Firebase project">
	1. Set up a React Native Firebase project by following the [prerequisites in
	the React Native Firebase
	documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/#1-install-via-npm). 2. Navigate to the
	[Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new
	project. 3. Navigate to Authentication > Sign-in method, to enable the
	[Email/Password
	provider](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage#emailpassword-sign-in)
</Step>

<Step title="Set up the custom JSON Web Keys link through dashboard">

1. Navigate to Wallets > [In-App Wallets](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/wallets/embedded)
2. To use in-app wallets, choose an existing API key or create a new one. Learn more about API keys.

   <DocImage src={ewCreateKey} />

3. In the configuration view, enable **Custom JSON Web Token.**

   <DocImage src={configurationView} />

4. Set the [JWKS URI from here](https://www.googleapis.com/service_accounts/v1/jwk/securetoken@system.gserviceaccount.com)

5. Set the AUD Value as the Firebase `projectId`. (Example, `custom-auth-53169`)

   <DocImage src={customJsonFirebase} />

6. Select **Save changes**.

</Step>

<Step title="Add the Firebase auth dependencies">
Firebase auth depends on the `firebase/app` and `firebase/auth` packages.

To add the packages, run the following command in the project:

```bash
yarn add @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth
```

</Step>

<Step title="Implement Email Authentication">
Add the code snippet below to handle email authentication with Firebase. Note that you need to add UI to allow users to input the email and password fields in your `App.tsx` file:

To handle email authentication with Firebase

```jsx
import auth from "@react-native-firebase/auth";

async function signInWithEmail(email, password) {
	try {
		await auth().createUserWithEmailAndPassword(email, password);
	} catch (error) {
		console.error(error);
	}
}

return (
	<Button title="Sign In" onPress={() => signInWithEmail(email, password)} />
);
```

Note: You may add a UI to allow users to input email and password fields.

</Step>

<Step title="Obtain the JWT">
Once the user is authenticated, you can listen to `AuthStateChanged` [events to get the signed in user](https://rnfirebase.io/auth/usage#listening-to-authentication-state). You can then get the JWT from the User object:

To receive the signed in user, listen to the `AuthStateChanged` event. You can add this code in your App.tsx file as well:

```jsx
const [user, setUser] = useState();

function onAuthStateChanged(user) {
	setUser(user);
}

useEffect(() => {
	// Listens to AuthStateChanged events
	const subscriber = auth().onAuthStateChanged(onAuthStateChanged);
	return subscriber;
}, [onAuthStateChanged]);

async function getFirebaseJWT() {
	if (user) {
		return await user.getIdToken();
	} else {
		throw new Error("User is not authenticated");
	}
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Pass the JWT to InAppWallet">
Pass the JWT to the In-App Wallet config in your `App.tsx` file:

```jsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const connectInApp = async (jwt: string) => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "jwt",
			jwt: await getFirebaseJWT(),
			encryptionKey: "your-encryption-key",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

You can set your `encryptionKey` in either a secret env variable or ask the user to enter a password for it.

** Do not hardcode the `encryptionKey` in your code. **

After the connectInApp function returns, the ThirdwebProvider will have connected a wallet thereby granting access to all hooks and functionalities.

</Step>

<Step title="Access the connected account">
To access the connected account, use the `useActiveAccount()` hook:

```jsx
import { useActiveAccount } from "thirdweb/react";

const activeWallet = useActiveAccount();
```

</Step>

</Steps>
