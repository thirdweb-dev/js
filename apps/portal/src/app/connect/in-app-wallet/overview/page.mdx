# In-App Wallet

In-app wallets are wallets that get spun up for users when they first come into your app. They are designed to help app developers building web3 apps for mainstream audiences build seamless login experiences.

Users can login using their email address, social logins (twitter, apple, discord, etc), or any Open ID Compatible authentication service. Once they authenticate they are provisioned a wallet, which they can then use to perform onchain actions like minting NFTs and sending transactions.
