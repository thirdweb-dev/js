# Managing Ecosystem Permissions

There are two permission options depending on whether you’d like an open or exclusive ecosystem wallet. You can manage these permissions from the Permissions page in your Ecosystem Wallet Dashboard.

### Anyone

If you want to allow anyone to integrate your ecosystem wallet, no other changes are required. You can protect your ecosystem against malicious actors by adding unwanted domains to your blocklist.

### Allowlist

If you’re looking to create an ecosystem wallet for select partners, you can head to the Ecosystem Wallet dashboard, navigate to Permissions, and select “Allowlist”.

**Add Applications to Your Allowlist**

For each application on your allowlist, you'll need to specify a name, a list of allowed domains, and an optional bundle ID (for mobile applications). The list of domains will determine where a partner will be able to display your ecosystem as a login option. Once a partner is added, a **Partner ID** will be generated.

	You'll need to add your own domains and bundle IDs to your allowlist in order
	to login through your ecosystem wallet in your app.
