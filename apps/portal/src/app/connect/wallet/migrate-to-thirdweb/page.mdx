# Migration Guide

Migrating from another embedded wallet provider is possible even if your users have assets and funds on their existing wallets. 

If you are thinking of migrating your users off another embedded wallet provider to thirdweb, please [reach out to us](https://thirdweb.com/contact-us) and we will consult and assist with the process.

If youâ€™d prefer to use your existing solutions for now and take advantage of thirdweb for other parts of your application, we recommend using the [Connect SDK adapters](/typescript/v5/adapters).
