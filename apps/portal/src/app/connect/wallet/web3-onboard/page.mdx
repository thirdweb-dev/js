# Web3 Onboard

thirdweb acquired Web3Onboard by Blocknative on 1/13/2025. We will be quickly migrating the documentation over to thirdweb in the coming weeks. For now, please refer to [Web3 Onboard's documentation](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/overview/introduction)

If you have any questions on how to migrate over to thirdweb's SDK, please review our docs or [visit our support site](https://thirdweb.com/support).
