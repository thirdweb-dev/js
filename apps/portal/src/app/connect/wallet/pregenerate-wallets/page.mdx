# Pregenerate Wallets

## What is Wallet Pregeneration?

Wallet pregeneration is a technique where you create wallets for users before they actually sign up or authenticate. This allows you to:

1. Pre assign wallets to users before they sign up
2. Reduce the time users spend waiting during the onboarding process
3. Pre-fund wallets with tokens or NFTs before users claim them
4. Create smoother user experiences for gaming and other applications

## Why Use Wallet Pregeneration?

### Pre-funding Capability
You can distribute assets to wallets before users claim them, enabling:
- Pre-loaded game assets
- Welcome bonus tokens
- Promotional NFTs
- Airdrops

### Better User Experience
- Users don't have to wait for wallet to be created during signup
- Reduced failed wallet creation due to network issues

To pregenerate an in-app or ecosystem wallet wallet, you can make a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

```
https://in-app-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/v1/pregenerate
```

## Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following parameters:

- `strategy`: The strategy for wallet generation
- `email` or `phone` or `userId`: The user identifier associated with the wallet to be generated

### Email based wallets

```
{ strategy: "email", email: "user@example.com" }
```

When the user logs in with any method associated with that email (including google, facebook, discord auth), they will get access to the same pregenerated wallet.

### Phone based wallets

```
{ strategy: "phone", phone: "+1321123321" }
```

### Custom user id based wallets

```
{ strategy: "custom_auth_endpoint", userId: "some_user_id" }
```

{/* TODO: update link when custom auth documentation has been updated */}
Use this when [bringing your own authentication method](/connect/in-app-wallet/custom-auth/configuration). When the user logs in, if the user ids you provide from the auth endpoint match, they will get access to the same pregenerated wallet.

## Headers

You need to include the following headers:

- `Content-Type`: Must be set to `application/json`
- `x-secret-key`: Your secret key for authentication
- `x-ecosystem-id` (optional): Your ecosystem ID
- `x-ecosystem-partner-id` (optional): Your ecosystem partner ID

## Example curl Command

Here's an example curl command to pregenerate a thirdweb wallet for the user `user@example.com`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://embedded-wallet.thirdweb.com/api/v1/pregenerate' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-id: ecosystem.example-eco-123' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-partner-id: 1415d24e-c7b0-4fce-846e-740841ef2c32' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: 9f8e7d6c5b4a3f2e1d0c9b8a7ffge434b2a1f0e9d8c7b6a5f4e3d2c1b0a9f8e7' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "strategy": "email",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }'
```

Replace the header values with your actual client ID, ecosystem ID, and secret key.

<Callout variant='info' title='Pregeneration for ecosystems'>
For ecosystem wallets, the secret key have to be from the same account as the ecosystem owner. If this is an issue, please reach out to us.
</Callout>


## Response Format

A successful API call returns a JSON object in the following format:

```json
{
  "wallet": {
      "address": "string",
      "createdAt": "string",
  }
}
```

<Callout variant='warning' title='Smart Wallet Address'>
Use [`predictSmartAccountAddress`](/references/typescript/v5/predictSmartAccountAddress) to generate the corresponding smart wallet address.
The `address` field always corresponds to the EOA address that has been pregenerated.
</Callout>


## What's Next

Pre-generating is independent and doesn't change the user's experience. 

Your users can continue to login as per usual. When they do, they will be assigned the pregenerated wallet.
