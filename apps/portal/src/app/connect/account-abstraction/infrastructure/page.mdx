# Bundler & Paymaster Infrastructure

The thirdweb SDK handles all the heavy lifting of bundling operations and covering gas fees with a turn-key infrastructure.
The thirdweb paymaster and bundler services are **stand alone** and can be used with any smart account contract without using the thirdweb SDKs.

On testnets, the only requirement is to obtain a free client id to get started.
Once you're ready to deploy on mainnets, you will require an active [billing account](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/settings/billing).
You can configure your client ID to restrict interactions only with your own contracts or with any contract.

### Supported chains

With a thirdweb API key, you get access to bundler and paymaster infrastructure on the following chains:

## Using Paymaster & Bundler URL

To use the Paymaster & Bundler URL for thirdweb, you can follow the guide below:

### URL Pattern

The URL pattern is predictable for all chains and is used for both paymaster and bundler operations:

```
https://<chain_id>.bundler.thirdweb.com/v2/<thirdweb-client-id>
```

Replace `<chain_id>` with the appropriate chain ID and `<thirdweb-client-id>` with your thirdweb client ID.

### Client ID in Header

You can also pass the client ID via the header:

```
x-client-id: <your_thirdweb_client_id>
```

### Frontend Calls

For frontend calls, the calling domain needs to be allowlisted. This can be done from the thirdweb dashboard in the API key settings.

### Backend Usage

For backend usage, the secret key is required as a header, and the client ID can be omitted:

```
x-secret-key: <your_thirdweb_secret_key>
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values. This guide will help you set up and use Paymaster & Bundler URLs effectively with thirdweb.

## Using a Custom Bundler

Smart accounts are free to use with your own account abstraction infrastructure. To use your own paymaster & bundler,
pass the `bundlerUrl` the `SmartWalletOptions` overrides:

```ts
const config: SmartWalletOptions = {
	chain,
	sponsorGas: true,
	overrides: {
		bundlerUrl: "your-bundler-url",
	},
};
```

## Using a Custom Paymaster

You can also provide an entirely custom paymaster logic by providing a `paymaster` function to the `SmartWalletOptions` overrides.

```ts
const config: SmartWalletOptions = {
	chain,
	sponsorGas: true,
	overrides: {
		paymaster: async (userOp: UserOperation) => {
			// your custom paymaster logic
			return myPaymasterResultLogic(userOp);
		},
	},
};
```

## Pricing & Billing

To use thirdweb's account abstraction infrastructure, you need to set up a billing account on the thirdweb dashboard Settings page.

**Pricing**:

- **Bundler**: Transaction bundle calls (non-sponsored calls) are free to use.
- **Paymaster**: 10% premium on top of network fee based on your usage.

Find more information on the different billing tiers by visiting [thirdweb's pricing page](https://thirdweb.com/pricing).
