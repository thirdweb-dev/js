# Leverage Cross-Chain Swaps with Universal Bridge

Learn how to enable your users to swap from any asset to any other with thirdweb's Universal Bridge.

In this guide, we'll show you how to purchase 10 USDC on Optimism in Typescript.

---

<Steps>
<Step title='Install the Connect SDK'>
<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn add thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
/>
<Step title='Get Your Client ID'>

Log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team). Click on Create New > Project to get your **Client ID**. You'll need your Client ID to interact with the Connect SDK.

</Step>
</Step>
<Step title='Find available routes'>
Before your user can select which tokens they'd like to swap, they'll need to find available routes.

You can do this using the `routes` function in our `Bridge` namespace. You or your users can filter by origin and destination chains and/or tokens. Pagination is also built-in to the function.

```tsx
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";

// Get all available routes
const allRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// Filter routes for a specific token or chain
const filteredRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
  originChainId: 1, // From Ethereum
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // To Optimism
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// Paginate through routes
const paginatedRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
  client: thirdwebClient,
});
```

This will return an array of `Route` objects, which will include information such as `symbol`, `address`, and `chainId` for both the origin and destination tokens.

</Step>
<Step title='Get a quote'>
Once you know which routes are available, you can retrieve a quote to show the user how much they can expect to pay for a given swap.

In this example, we'll use the `Buy.quote` function to get a quote for buying 10 USDC on Optimism for Base ETH.

<Callout variant="info">
  The `Buy` namespace is purpose-built for when you want to obtain a specific amount of the output token.
  If you have a specific input amount and are flexible on the output amount, you can use the `Sell` namespace.
  Learn more about sells [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/sell/prepare).
</Callout>

Quote allows us to get an expected amount before the user has connected their wallet. This quote won't come with executable transactions, and won't be a guaranteed price.


```tsx
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";

const buyQuote = await Bridge.Buy.quote({
  originChainId: 8453, // Base
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // Optimism
  destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // Optimism USDC
  buyAmountWei: 10000000n, // 10 USDC
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

console.log(
  `To get ${buyQuote.destinationAmount} wei on destination chain, you need to pay ${buyQuote.originAmount} wei`,
);
```

This will return a `Quote` object, which will include the `originAmount` and `destinationAmount` in wei, along with some more useful information about the predicted quote.
</Step>
<Step title='Get the prepared transaction'>
Now that we know how much the user can expect to pay, we can have them connect their wallet and execute the swap.

To get a prepared quote, we'll use the `Buy.prepare` function. The key difference with this function is it requires a `sender` and `receiver` to be specified.

```tsx
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";

const preparedBuy = await Bridge.Buy.prepare({
  originChainId: 8453, // Base
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // Optimism
  destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // Optimism USDC
  buyAmountWei: 10000000n, // 10 USDC
  sender: "0x...", // Your user's wallet address
  receiver: "0x...", // Recipient address (can be the same as sender)
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// The prepared quote contains the transactions you need to execute
console.log(`Transactions to execute: ${preparedBuy.transactions.length}`);
```

This will return a `PreparedQuote` object. It will look very similar to the `Quote` you received in the previous step, but it will include a `transactions` array. This array will contain the transactions you need to execute to complete the swap.
</Step>
<Step title='Execute the swap'>
To execute the swap, we'll need to send all transactions in the `transactions` array one after the other.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Currently, the `transactions` array does not include approvals. You'll need to execute any necessary approvals prior to executing the swap transactions.
</Callout>

```tsx
import { sendTransaction, waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb";

const preparedBuy = await Bridge.Buy.prepare({
  originChainId: 8453, // Base
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // Optimism
  destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // Optimism USDC
  buyAmountWei: 10000000n, // 10 USDC
  sender: "0x...", // Your user's wallet address
  receiver: "0x...", // Recipient address (can be the same as sender)
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

};

for (const transaction of preparedBuy.transactions) {
  const tx = prepareTransaction({
    to: transaction.to as string,
    value: BigInt(transaction.value ?? 0n),
    data: transaction.data,
    chain: defineChain(transaction.chainId),
    client
  });

  const result = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({ transaction: tx, account });
  let swapStatus;
  do {
    swapStatus = await Bridge.status({
      transactionHash: result.transactionHash,
      client,
    });
  } while (swapStatus.status !== "COMPLETED");
};
```

<Callout variant="info">
  The returned transactions follow the [Ox](https://oxlib.sh/) standard [TransactionEnvelopeEip1559](https://oxlib.sh/guides/transaction-envelopes)
  format. This is a simple transaction with `data`, `to`, `value`, and `chainId` properties. **Gas is not included in the transaction, and should
  be estimated separately if necessary.** Normally, the thirdweb SDK will handle this for you.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title='Getting the swap status'>
You'll notice in the previous step we call `Bridge.status` to get the status of the swap. We can get the status of any past swap using just the transaction hash and chain ID of its origin transaction.

When sending the transactions in a prepared quote, you **must** use `Bridge.status` to get the `COMPLETED` status before moving on to the next transaction. This is because `status` waits for both the origin
and destination transactions to complete. Waiting for the origin transaction receipt is not sufficient since the funds might not have arrived on the destination chain yet.

The `status` will also return all transactions (origin and destination) involved in the swap.
```tsx
import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

// Check the status of a bridge transaction
const bridgeStatus = await Bridge.status({
  transactionHash:
    "0xe199ef82a0b6215221536e18ec512813c1aa10b4f5ed0d4dfdfcd703578da56d",
  chainId: 8453, // The chain ID where the transaction was initiated
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// The status will be one of: "COMPLETED", "PENDING", "FAILED", or "NOT_FOUND"
if (bridgeStatus.status === "completed") {
  console.log(`
    Bridge completed!
    Sent: ${bridgeStatus.originAmount} wei on chain ${bridgeStatus.originChainId}
    Received: ${bridgeStatus.destinationAmount} wei on chain ${bridgeStatus.destinationChainId}
  `);
} else if (bridgeStatus.status === "pending") {
  console.log("Bridge transaction is still pending...");
} else {
  console.log("Bridge transaction failed");
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>
