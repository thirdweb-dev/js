# Accept Direct Payments with Pay & Engine

Learn how to accept fiat and crypto from your customers with Pay and trigger Engine actions, like minting NFTs or transferring tokens to user wallets.

### Requirements

- [A thirdweb Client ID](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/client)
- [An Engine Instance](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine)

### Purchase Flow Overview

Before jumping in, it's important to understand the full system, from initial purchase to the eventual transfer of assets. This is a four step process (with an optional fifth):

<DocImage src={DirectPaymentsFlow} />

1. **User Initiates Purchase:** User sends specified funds (ETH, MATIC, USD, etc.) to your wallet via thirdweb Pay.
   - Your wallet can be any business wallet you choose or your Engine backend wallet.
   - Use the `purchaseData` field to pass any item data needed in the webhook.
     E.g., `{ nftId: 1 }`.
2. **Pay Processes Purchase:** thirdweb Pay processes the transaction and sends a [Purchase Complete webhook](/connect/pay/webhooks#purchase-complete) to your dapp’s server when the transaction is complete.
3. **Your Server Calls Engine:** Your server processes the webhook and sends a contract call to the thirdweb Engine backend wallet to perform the item purchase.
4. **Engine Executes the Transaction:** Engine backend wallet executes the transaction needed to deliver the token(s) to the user’s address.
5. **(Optional) User Is Notified :** Your server confirms the completed Engine transaction and notifies the user.

Now, let's get started.

<Steps>
	<Step title="Set Up thirdweb Engine">

    	1. If you haven't already, log in and [deploy an Engine
    	instance](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine)

    	2. Create or import a backend wallet for Engine in [your Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine).

    	3. Send the required funds to the backend wallet
    		* For example, if purchasing with Arb Nova USDC, then your backend wallet should hold this ERC20 token.
    		* If your backend wallet holds an ERC20 token, ensure to add a native token balance as well to cover gas costs. For example, for a transaction on Arbitrum Nova, your backend wallet should hold both Arb Nova USDC (for payment) and Arb Nova ETH (for gas).
    		* Your backend wallet should hold enough liquidity to handle any anticipated purchasing volume.

    	4. Make a plan to monitor and keep the float wallet topped up to avoid any issues with the service.

    <Step title="Integrate thirdweb Pay (Client)">
    	1. [Integrate thirdweb Pay](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect/pay/build-a-custom-experience) on the client side to enable fiat and crypto payments.


    	2. Specify the required parameters for your Pay transaction.

    		```ts
    		const quote = await getBuyWithFiatQuote({
    			client: client, // thirdweb client
    			fromCurrencySymbol: "USD", // fiat currency symbol
    			toChainId: arbnova.id, // arbitrum nova chain id
    			toAmount: "100", // amount of token to buy
    			toTokenAddress: USDC_TOKEN_ADDRESS, // address of payment token
    			fromAddress: "<USERS_WALLET_ADDRESS>",
    			toAddress: "<YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS>",
    				purchaseData: {
    					nftId: 1
    				}
    			});
    		```

    		|Parameter|Type|Description|
    		|----|--|--|
    		|fromCurrencySymbol|`string`|The fiat currency symbol you'd like to accept (currently limited to USD and EUR) |
    		|toChainId|`string`|[Chain ID](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist) for the destination token.|
    		|toTokenAddress|`string`|Address of the destination token.|
    		|toAmount|`string`|The price of the asset denominated in your desination token.|
    		|fromAddress|`string`|The user's wallet address.|
    		|toAddress|`string`|The wallet you'd like funds to be sent to. This can be your business wallet or an Engine backend wallet. |
    		|purchaseData|`Object`|Any details you need to pass in order to track your transaction. If this is a secondary sale, you may want to include details like `{ nftId: 1, orderId: 1 }` |

</Step>
  <Step title="Integrate thirdweb Pay (Server)">
		1. Log in & create a “Purchase Complete” webhook in your Team > Connect > Pay > Webhooks page.
		2. The [Pay webhook POST response](/connect/pay/webhooks#purchase-complete) will include the BuyWithCryptoStatus or BuyWithFiatStatus in the body.
			* This will also include the purchaseData you previously passed (metadata identifying the customer information, etc.).
			* A request will be sent on every status change.
		3. Listen for [completed purchase statuses](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect/pay/build-a-custom-experience#Poll%20for%20Transaction%20Status). Note that if this is a two-step BuyWithFiat transaction (onramp, then swap), you should also listen for `CRYPTO_SWAP_COMPLETED`
		4. When a purchase is completed, determine the purchaser, order and validate the amounts.
			- The fromAddress in the status will show purchasing address
			- The purchaseData will contain more information you previously for the purchase details
			- Validate the information. For example, 100 USDC was sent to your wallet.
		5. Send a contract call to Engine for the float wallet to purchase the item
			- For example, send a transaction to the float wallet for `mintTo(fromAddress)`
			- For secondary purchases, like a marketplace direct listing, you can use the appropriate Engine endpoint, passing the ultimate recipient of the NFT as the buyer
		6. Confirm the purchase was successful.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once you've completed all of these steps, you'll be ready to offer a great purchase UX for your users.
