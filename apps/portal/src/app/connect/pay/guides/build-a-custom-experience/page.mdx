# Build a Custom Fiat Experience

Learn how to enable your users to purchase your application’s token with any fiat payment method with our headless flow.

In this guide, we'll show you how to purchase 0.01 Base ETH from USD in Typescript.

<Callout variant="info">
	Our `PayEmbed` component handles the complexity of the process detailed below
	and can be integrated in minutes. We encourage you to check out the [PayEmbed
	guide here](/connect/pay/get-started#option-2-embed-pay).

<Steps>
<Step title='Install the Connect SDK'>
<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn install thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
/>
<Step title='Get Your Client ID'>

Log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard). Navigate to the **Settings** page and create an API key to get your **Client ID**. You'll need your Client ID to interact with the Connect SDK.

<Step title='Get a “Buy with Fiat” quote'>
Buying with fiat can require one or two steps depending on your destination token:

If the destination token _*can*_ be bought directly with fiat, your users can onramp directly to their destination token.

If the destination token _*can not*_ be bought directly with fiat, your users will need to onramp to an intermediate token, then convert the onramp token to the destination token.

For example, when Buying Base ETH:

1. Users will receive Avalance AVAX ( native token ) in exchange for USD
2. Users will be prompted to convert Avalanche AVAX to Base ETH

<DocImage src={OnrampStepOne} />

This process requires your user's wallet address. Refer to [this guide](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/connecting-wallets) to learn how to connect a wallet.

```tsx
import { getBuyWithFiatQuote } from "thirdweb/pay";
import { NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";
import { base } from "thirdweb/chains";

// create a thirdweb client
const client = createThirdwebClient({
	clientId: "<your_client_id>",
});

// Get a quote for buying 0.01 Base ETH with USD
const quote = await getBuyWithFiatQuote({
	client: client, // thirdweb client
	fromCurrencySymbol: "USD", // fiat currency symbol
	toChainId: base.id, // base chain id
	toAmount: "0.01", // amount of token to buy
	toTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, // native token
	toAddress: "0x...", // user's wallet address
});

// display quote information to user
console.log(quote.fromCurrencyWithFees);
console.log(quote.processingFees);
console.log(quote.onRampToken);
console.log(quote.toToken);
console.log(quote.estimatedDurationSeconds);
// etc...
```

The `quote` object contains detailed transaction information including the estimated time, processing fees, amount of fiat currency required, and more that you can display in your application.

</Step>
<Step title='Check for a Buy With Crypto Step'>
The `quote` object contains `quote.onRampToken` and `quote.toToken` objects containing intermediate and detination token information.

If `quote.onRampToken` is not the same as `quote.toToken`, then your users will need to onramp to intermediary token before arriving at their destination token.

You can use `isSwapRequiredPostOnramp` to check this

```tsx
import { isSwapRequiredPostOnramp } from "thirdweb/pay";

const hasTwoSteps = isSwapRequiredPostOnramp(quote);

if (hasTwoSteps) {
	// display the two steps to the user
}
```

</Step>
<Step title='Display the Onramp Experience'>
Once you have a `quote` from `getBuyWithFiatQuote`, you can open a new tab with `quote.onRampLink` to show the onramp experience. This onramp experience handles all regulatory requirements, know your customer (KYC) verifications, and sanctions screening.

After they've KYC'd (if required), customers have the option of saving payment methods, KYC data, and wallet information in the onramp, which makes the returning onramp experience much faster.

Your users will be able to purchase the `quote.onRampToken` with the specified fiat currency.

```ts
window.open(quote.onRampLink, "_blank");
```

</Step>
<Step title='Poll for Transaction Status'>
When you open the `quote.onRampLink` in a new tab, you can begin polling for the onramp transaction status in your app by calling `getBuyWithFiatStatus`.

`getBuyWithFiatStatus` requires an `intentId` which you can get from `quote` object.

`getBuyWithFiatStatus` requires passing an `intentId` which you can get from `quote` object.

There are a number of transactions statuses:

```tsx
// Keep calling the below code at some regular intervals to poll the status

const fiatStatus = await getBuyWithFiatStatus({
	client: client, // thirdweb client
	intentId: quote.intentId, // pass intentId from quote
});

if (fiatStatus.status === "NOT_FOUND") {
	// invalid intentId
	// Show error in your page
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "NONE") {
	// No information available yet
	// Show "loading" status on your page
	// keep polling
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "PENDING_PAYMENT") {
	// Payment is in progress in the on-ramp provider
	// Show "loading" status on your page
	// keep polling
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "PENDING_ON_RAMP_TRANSFER") {
	// payment is done, on-ramp process has not started
	// show "loading" status on your page
	// keep polling
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_IN_PROGRESS") {
	// on-ramp provider is doing on-ramp with fiat currency
	// show "loading" status on your page
	// keep polling
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_FAILED") {
	// on-ramp provider failed to do onramp
	// show error in your UI
	// STOP polling
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_COMPLETED") {
	// if only on-ramp is required - process is done!
	if (!hasTwoSteps) {
		// show "success"
		// Stop polling
		// That's it!
	} else {
		// Wait for "CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED" state to convert tokens
		// Show "loading" status on your page
		// Stop polling
	}
}

if (fiatStatus.status === "CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED") {
	// go to step 5
	// Show UI for Buy with Crypto quote.onRampToken to quote.toToken
	// Stop polling
}
```

</Step>
<Step title='Get a Buy With Crypto Quote (Optional)'>
This step is only relevant when a crypto-to-crypto purchase is required after perfmorming an onramp to an intermediary token.

In this case, you can use `getPostOnRampQuote` to get a quote to convert the intermediary token to the destination token.

```tsx
// when fiatStatus.status === "CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED"
// and hasTwoStep === true

const swapQuote = await getPostOnRampQuote({
	client: client,
	buyWithFiatStatus: fiatStatus,
});

if (!swapQuote) {
	// invalid fiatStatus status
} else {
	// Go to step 6 to kick off the "Swap" flow
}
```

</Step>
<Step title='Execute Buy With Crypto'>
Executing Buy With Crypto may involve either a single step or 2 steps

If your source token is an ERC-20 token, an approval step is required before executing the Buy With Crypto transaction.

You can check if approval is required by checking `quote.approval`

```tsx
import { sendTransaction, waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb";

const account = wallet.getAccount();

// If approval is required, send the approval transaction
// show a button to user to request approval and send the transaction on click
if (quote.approval) {
	// request spending tokens from wallet
	const approveTxResult = await sendTransaction({
		transaction: quote.approval, // approval transaction
		account: account, // account from user's connected wallet
	});

	await waitForReceipt(approveTxResult);
}

// The above step may result in error if user rejects or transaction fails
// If it results in error, it needs to be done again until its successful

// Once the approval is done, you can send the buyWithCrypto transaction
// show a button to user to request sending buyWithCrypto transaction and send the transaction on click
const buyWithCryptoTxResult = await sendTransaction({
	transaction: quote.transactionRequest,
	account: account,
});

await waitForReceipt(buyWithCryptoTxResult);

// Save the buy with crypto transaction hash for polling the status as mentioned in step 7
const buyWithCryptoTxHash = buyWithCryptoTxResult.transactionHash;
```

</Step>
<Step title='Poll for Buy With Crypto Status'>
Once you've initiated your Buy With Crypto transaction, you'll want to track the status. You can notify users throughout this journey by checking for the following statuses:

```tsx
import { getBuyWithCryptoStatus } from 'thirdweb/pay'

// Keep calling the below code at regular intervals if the status is in a pending state

const swapStatus = await getBuyWithCryptoStatus({
   client: client,
   transactionHash: swapTxHash,
}});

if (swapStatus.status === "NOT_FOUND") {
// invalid swap tx
// Show error in your page
// Stop polling
}

if (swapStatus.status === "NONE") {
// No information available yet
// show "loading" in UI
// Keep polling
}

if (swapStatus.status === "FAILED") {
// swap failed
// show "error" in UI - show a retry option in UI
// Stop polling
}

if (swapStatus.status === "COMPLETED") {
// swap completed
// show "success" in UI
// Stop polling
}

if (swapStatus.status === "PENDING") {
// swap is in progress
// show "loading" in UI
// Keep polling
}

```

</Step>
</Steps>
