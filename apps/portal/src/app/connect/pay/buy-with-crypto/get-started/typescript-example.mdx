<Steps>

<Step title="Get a Buy Quote">

You can get a quote by using the [`getBuyWithCryptoQuote`](/references/typescript/v5/getBuyWithCryptoQuote) function.

This function takes an object with the following properties:

- **client:** The Thirdweb client instance.
- **fromAddress:** The address of the wallet initiating the transaction.
- **toTokenAddress:** The contract address of the destination token. This is the token the user wants to purchase.
- **fromTokenAddress:** The contract address of the source token. This is the token the user wants will use to purchase the destination token.
- **fromChainId**: The chain id of the source token.
- **toChainId:** The chain id of the destination token.
- **toAmount**: The amount of the token you to purchase.

Since you need to pass the `fromAddress` to function, you need to connect a wallet. Refer to [Connecting Wallets](/typescript/v5/wallets) guide to see how you can connect various wallets.

```tsx
import { NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
	clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
});

// connect a wallet to get an account
const metamask = createWallet("io.metamask");
const account = await metamask.connect();

const quote = await getBuyWithCryptoQuote({
	client: client,
	toAmount: "2", // 2 USDC
	toTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // USDC token on Optimism mainnet
	toChainId: 10, // Optimism mainnet
	fromChainId: 1, // Ethereum mainnet
	fromTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, // native token
	fromAddress: account.address, // wallet address
});
```

</Step>

<Step title="Send a Transaction">
Once you've received a quote, you can execute a buy transaction by using the [`sendTransaction`](/references/typescript/v5/sendTransaction) hook and then waiting for the transaction to be confirmed using the [`waitForReceipt`](/references/typescript/v5/waitForReceipt) function.

Note that buys with non-native (ERC20) tokens requires executing an approval transaction before executing the buy transaction as shown in the example below.

```ts
// if approval is required
if (quote.approval) {
	// send approval transaction
	const approveTx = await sendTransaction({
		account,
		transaction: quote.approval,
	});

	// wait for approval transaction to be confirmed
	await waitForReceipt(approveTx);
}

// send buy transaction
const buyTx = await sendTransaction({
	account,
	transaction: quote.transactionRequest,
});

// wait for buy transaction to be confirmed
await waitForReceipt(buyTx);
```

</Step>

<Step title="Listening to Transaction Status">
Once you've submitted the transaction, you can listen to a transaction's status using the [`useBuyWithCryptoStatus`](/references/typescript/v5/useBuyWithCryptoStatus) hook.

```ts
// keep polling at regular intervals until the status is "complete" or "failed"
async function pollForStatus(txHash: string) {
	const response = await getBuyWithCryptoStatus({
		client,
		transactionHash: txHash,
	});

	if (response.status === "COMPLETED" || response.status === "FAILED") {
		return response;
	} else {
		// wait for 5 seconds before polling again
		await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
		await pollForStatus(txHash);
	}
}

const response = await pollForStatus(buyTx.transactionHash);

console.log(response);
```

</Step>

<Step title="Set Up Fee Sharing">
	Now that you've set up Buy With Crypto, you can [configure a recipient
	address](/connect/pay/fee-sharing) to earn on every user transaction.
</Step>
