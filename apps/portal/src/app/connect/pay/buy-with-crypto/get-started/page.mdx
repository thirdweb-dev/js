# Get Started

Learn how to get a quote and send crypto purchase transactions.

## Using the Connect Interface

Buy With Crypto comes by default with our [ConnectButton](/react/v5/ConnectButton) React component.

You can simply add the `ConnectButton` component to your React app. Connect handles everything including connecting the user to various wallets, sending & receiving tokens, and buying with crypto.

## Using the SDK

There are 3 main steps to perform a Buy With Crypto transaction:

1. Get a price quote for the transaction
2. Execute the transaction with users connected wallet
3. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed by polling the status of the transaction

### Install thirdweb

```bash
npm install thirdweb
```

### Create a client

A client is required to use thirdweb SDK. Refer to [this guide](/typescript/v5/client) to learn how to create a client.
