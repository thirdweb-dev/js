### Get Started

- **Transaction Flow:** Allow users to [execute any transaction](/connect/pay/get-started#send-a-transaction-with-pay), even with an empty wallet.
- **Embed directly:** Use our [PayEmbed](/connect/pay/get-started#embed-pay) to enable onramps and crypto purchases directly in your interface.
- **The Connect Interface:** By [integrating our ConnectButton](/connect/ConnectButton), your users can onramp funds into their connected wallets.

### Pricing

thirdweb collects a 1% fee per end user transaction. We share 70% of this fee with you.

For example, if a user purchases $100 worth of Polygon through your application, thirdweb charges a total of $1.00. thirdweb collects $0.30 and sends $0.70 to you.
