## Fee Sharing

Thirdweb collects a 1% fee per end-user transaction and shares 70% of that fee with you. For example, on a $100 Polygon purchase, a $1.00 fee is charged—of which $0.30 is retained by thirdweb and $0.70 is remitted to you.

Note: Fee sharing applies only to fees from swaps and bridges; fiat purchases are excluded.

To enable fee sharing, simply set a recipient address in your dashboard under Team > Project > Connect > Pay in the thirdweb dashboard.
