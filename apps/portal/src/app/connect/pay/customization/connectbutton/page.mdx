# Customize ConnectButton

Learn how to customize Pay within the `ConnectButton` interface. You can find a selection of popular customizations below. For the full list of props, you can [view the full reference](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButtonProps).

---

## Customize Supported Tokens

You can enable users to select your token on a given chain by passing an array of `SupportedTokens`. Note that this array overrides all default tokens listed for that chain. Note that this will also show these tokens in the 'Send' screen to transfer tokens.

```tsx
<ConnectButton
	client={client}
	supportedTokens={{
		"1": [
			{
				address: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
				name: "USD Coin",
				symbol: "USDC",
				icon: usdcIcon,
			},
		],
	}}
/>
```

---

## Prefill Destination Token

In the case you want your users to purchase your token by default in your application, you can choose to pre-fill the Pay purchase flow with `prefillBuy` .

For example, if you wanted users to only purchase Ethereum on Base network, you could do as follows:

```tsx
import { base } from "thirdweb/chains";

<ConnectButton
	client={client}
	detailsModal={{
		payOptions: {
			prefillBuy: {
				token: {
					address: "0x866a087038f7C12cf33EF91aC5b1AcE6Ac1DA788",
					name: "Base ETH",
					symbol: "ETH",
					icon: "...", // optional
				},
				chain: base,
				allowEdits: {
					amount: true, // allow editing buy amount
					token: false, // disable selecting buy token
					chain: false, // disable selecting buy chain
				},
			},
		},
	}}
/>;
```

If you'd like to prefill a purchase with a native token, you can set the chain without passing a token:

```tsx
<ConnectButton
	client={client}
	detailsModal={{
		payOptions: {
			prefillBuy: {
				chain: base,
			},
		},
	}}
/>
```

## Preferred Provider

You can specify which onramp provider to present to your users. By default, we choose a recommended provider based on the location of the user, KYC status, and currency. Please make sure your set provider is [available in your country](../onramp-providers).

```tsx
<ConnectButton
	client={client}
	detailsModal={{
		payOptions: {
			preferredProvider: "STRIPE" | "KADO" | "TRANSAK",
		},
	}}
/>
```

---

## Disable Payment Methods

In some cases, you may only want to show users fiat or crypto payment options for your onchain goods or services. You can do this by setting either `buyWithCrypto` or `buyWithFiat` to `false`.

#### Disable Buy With Crypto

```tsx
<ConnectButton
	client={client}
	detailsModal={{
		payOptions: {
			buyWithCrypto: false,
		},
	}}
/>
```

#### Disable Buy With Fiat

```tsx
<ConnectButton
	client={client}
	detailsModal={{
		payOptions: {
			buyWithFiat: false,
		},
	}}
/>
```

---

## Theme

You can set the theme for the Pay component, which is set to `"dark"` by default. theme can be set to either `"dark"` , `"light"` or a custom theme object.

We have [`lightTheme`](/references/typescript/v5/lightTheme) or [`darkTheme`](/references/typescript/v5/darkTheme) providers that you can override to kickstart customization.

You can refer to our [`Theme`](/references/typescript/v5/Theme) page for a full view of customizable options if you’d prefer to create a custom theme from scratch.

#### Provided Themes

```tsx
<ConnectButton theme='light' />

<ConnectButton theme='dark' />
```

#### Custom Theme

```tsx
import { darkTheme } from 'thirdweb/react';

// Using custom theme
<ConnectButton theme={darkTheme({ ... })} />

```
