# Fee Sharing

thirdweb collects a 1% fee per end user transaction. We share 70% of this fee with you.

For example, if a user purchases $100 worth of Polygon through your application, thirdweb charges a total of $1.00. thirdweb collects $0.30 and sends $0.70 to you.

Plase note that fee sharing only applies to fees collected through swaps and bridges. Fiat purchases do not currently qualify for fee sharing.

To participate in fee sharing, all you need to do is set a recipient address in your dashboard. Your recipient address can be configured in your dashboard by navigating to [Connect > Pay](https://www.thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/pay).
