# ConnectButton

The `ConnectButton` component unlocks all of thirdwebâ€™s login, onboarding, and blockchain interaction capabilities via a customizable and secure interface.

<DocImage src={connectModal} />

When logged out, the `ConnectButton` offers users secure login methods with email, phone, socials, and external wallets. When logged in, the ConnectButton enables users to send and receive funds to their account, purchase crypto with onramps, and execute transactions within your application.



## Get started

### Automatic Setup

Starter templates are pre-configured with `ConnectButton` to help you get started quickly.

In your CLI, run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --app
```

Select a framework: Next, Vite, or Expo. The command will create a new directory with starter code and the necessary dependencies installed.

### Manual Setup

<Steps>
<Step title="Install">
Install the Connect SDK

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn add thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
	bun="bun i thirdweb"
/>
</Step>

<Step title="Obtain Client Id">
On the thirdweb dashboard, navigate to settings to [create an API Key](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys) to obtain a Client Id. 
</Step>

<Step title="Add ConnectButton component">
In your application, initialize and add the `ConnectButton` component by passing in your Client Id. 

```ts
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Configure login options">

Configure the `wallets` property to enable various login options such as email & phone number, socials, and EOAs such as MetaMask or Phantom. 

```ts
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { createWallet, inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallets = [
  inAppWallet(),
  createWallet("io.metamask"),
  createWallet("com.coinbase.wallet"),
  createWallet("me.rainbow"),
];

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets}/>
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}

```

import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { lightTheme } from "thirdweb/react";
 
const customTheme = lightTheme({
  colors: {
    modalBg: "red",
  },
});

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} theme={customTheme}/>
