# Customization Options

Our ConnectButton and ConnectEmbed components are highly customizable. You can find a selection of popular customizations below. For the full list of props, you can [view the full reference](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButtonProps).

## Logo

You can customize the logo shown on the Connect modal by adding it to the `appMetadata` prop:

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<ConnectButton
				appMetadata={{
					logoUrl: "https://path/to/my-app/logo.svg",
				}}
			/>
		</div>
	);
}
```

The Connect modal is set to `"wide"` by default. You can set it to `"compact"` by adding it to the `connectModal` prop:

```tsx

	return (
		<div>
			<ConnectButton connectModal={{ size: "compact" }} />
		</div>
	);
}
```

## Theming

You can set the theme for the [ConnectButton](https://www.notion.so/ConnectButton-51113a400e614dfe93a598e9e1b8ef63?pvs=21) component, which is set to `"dark"` by default. theme can be set to either `"dark"` , `"light"` or a custom theme object.

We have **`[lightTheme](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/lightTheme)`** or **`[darkTheme](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/darkTheme)`** providers that you can override to kickstart customization.

You can refer to our `Theme` page for a full view of customizable options if you’d prefer to create a custom theme from scratch.

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<ConnectButton theme={yourThemeConfig} />
		</div>
	);
}
```
