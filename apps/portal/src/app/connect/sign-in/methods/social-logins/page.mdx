# Social Logins

thirdweb uses the [OAuth 2.0 Protocol](https://oauth.net/2/) to enable social login. By default, the connect UI supports Google, Apple, Facebook.

For all social login methods, thirdweb generates a non-custodial [in-app wallet](https://www.notion.so/Overview-1f9cf61712be4c1788c25bc3457f6523?pvs=21) behind the scenes within your application. In-app wallets enable your users to interact with your application, as well as store tokens and assets they receive while interacting with your application.

## Add Social Login options

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

const wallets = [
	inAppWallet({
		providers: ["facebook", "apple", "google"],
	}),
];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

## Interacting with your App

Once a user signed in and their wallet is generated, you can use the **[Wallet Connection hooks](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/hooks#wallet-connection)** to get information about the connected wallet like getting the address, account, and more.
