# Email & Phone Number Sign-In

Users can sign in through Connect via a one-time password sent to their email or SMS.

For both OTP login methods, thirdweb generates a non-custodial in-app wallet within your application. In-app wallets enable your users to interact with your application, as well as store tokens and assets they receive while interacting with your application.

## Add in-app wallet

To add phone and email sign-in options, pass `inAppWallet` to the `wallets` array.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: your_client_id });

const wallets = [
	inAppWallet({
		providers: ["email", "phone"],
	}),
];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

<Callout variant="info" title="Display Order">
	By default, email login is displayed before phone number login. To display
	phone number first, add "phone" before "email" in the providers array
</Callout>

## Interacting with your App

Once a user is signed in and their wallet is generated, use the **[Wallet Connection hooks](/references/typescript/v5/hooks#wallet-connection)** to get information about the connected wallet such as the wallet address, account, and more.
