# Smart Accounts with Universal Bridge

Learn how to leverage EIP7702 smart accounts to batch Universal Bridge transactions for optimal user experience. This approach enables gasless transactions, batched execution, and seamless cross-chain operations.

Smart accounts with EIP7702 allow you to upgrade any EOA (Externally Owned Account) into a smart account without code changes, enabling advanced features like transaction batching and gas sponsorship.

<Step title='Set up EIP7702 In-App Wallet'>

Configure an in-app wallet with EIP7702 execution mode to enable smart account features:

```typescript
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ 
  clientId: "your_client_id" 
});

// Create in-app wallet with EIP7702 smart account features
const wallet = inAppWallet({
  executionMode: {
    mode: "EIP7702",
    sponsorGas: true, // Enable gas sponsorship
  },
});

// Connect the wallet
const account = await wallet.connect({
  client,
  strategy: "google", // or other auth strategies
});
```

  EIP7702 execution mode upgrades your EOA into a smart account, enabling batched transactions, gas sponsorship, and other advanced features without requiring contract deployment.

</Step>
<Step title='Prepare Batched Bridge Transactions'>

Use Universal Bridge to prepare transactions, then batch them per step (since each step may be on a different chain):

```typescript
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, toWei } from "thirdweb";
import { sendBatchTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const bridgePreparation = await Bridge.Buy.prepare({
  originChainId: 1, // Ethereum
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 137, // Polygon
  destinationTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  amount: toWei("0.1"), // 0.1 MATIC
  sender: account.address,
  receiver: account.address,
  client,
});
```

<Callout variant="important">
  **Key Rule**: You can only batch transactions that are on the same chain. Since Universal Bridge steps may span multiple chains, you must batch transactions within each step separately, not across steps.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title='Execute Batched Transactions'>

Execute transactions in batches per step (same chain), proceeding through steps sequentially:

```typescript
import { sendBatchTransaction, waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb";
// Execute each step's transactions as a batch (same chain)
for (let i = 0; i < bridgePreparation.steps.length; i++) {
  const step = bridgePreparation.steps[i];

  // Batch all transactions within this step (they're all on the same chain)
  const stepBatchResult = await sendBatchTransaction({
    transactions: step.transactions,
    account,
  });

  console.log(`Step ${i + 1} batch sent:`, stepBatchResult.transactionHash);

  const receipt = await waitForReceipt({
    client,
    chain: step.transactions[0].chain,
    transactionHash: stepBatchResult.transactionHash,
  });

  console.log(`Step ${i + 1} completed:`, receipt.status);

    // Monitor bridge completion status for this step
    let bridgeStatus;
    do {
      bridgeStatus = await Bridge.status({
        transactionHash: stepBatchResult.transactionHash,
        chainId: step.transactions[0].chainId,
        client,
      });
      
      if (bridgeStatus.status === "PENDING") {
        console.log(`Bridge step ${i + 1} still pending...`);
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
      }
    } while (bridgeStatus.status === "PENDING");
    
    if (bridgeStatus.status === "COMPLETED") {
      console.log(`Bridge step ${i + 1} completed!`);
    } else if (bridgeStatus.status === "FAILED") {
      throw new Error(`Bridge step ${i + 1} failed`);
    }
}
```

<Callout variant="info">
  With EIP7702 smart accounts, transactions within each step execute atomically. Steps execute sequentially, ensuring proper cross-chain coordination. Gas sponsorship applies to all batched transactions.
