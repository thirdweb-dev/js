# Smart Accounts with Payments

Learn how to leverage EIP7702 smart accounts to batch Payments transactions for optimal user experience. This approach enables gasless transactions, batched execution, and seamless cross-chain operations.

Smart accounts with EIP7702 allow you to upgrade any EOA (Externally Owned Account) into a smart account without code changes, enabling advanced features like transaction batching and gas sponsorship.

<Step title='Set up EIP7702 In-App Wallet'>

Configure an in-app wallet with EIP7702 execution mode to enable smart account features:

```typescript
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ 
  clientId: "your_client_id" 
});

// Create in-app wallet with EIP7702 smart account features
const wallet = inAppWallet({
  executionMode: {
    mode: "EIP7702",
    sponsorGas: true, // Enable gas sponsorship
  },
});

// Connect the wallet
const account = await wallet.connect({
  client,
  strategy: "google", // or other auth strategies
});
```

  EIP7702 execution mode upgrades your EOA into a smart account, enabling batched transactions, gas sponsorship, and other advanced features without requiring contract deployment.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title='Prepare Batched Bridge Transactions'>

Use Payments to prepare transactions, then batch them per step (since each step may be on a different chain):

```typescript
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS, toWei } from "thirdweb";
import { sendBatchTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const bridgePreparation = await Bridge.Buy.prepare({
  originChainId: 1, // Ethereum
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 137, // Polygon
  destinationTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  amount: toWei("0.1"), // 0.1 MATIC
  sender: account.address,
  receiver: account.address,
  client,
});
```

<Callout variant="important">
  **Key Rule**: You can only batch transactions that are on the same chain. Since Payments steps may span multiple chains, you must batch transactions within each step separately, not across steps.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title='Execute Batched Transactions'>

Execute transactions in batches per step (same chain), proceeding through steps sequentially:

```typescript
import { sendBatchTransaction, waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb";
// Execute each step's transactions as a batch (same chain)
for (let i = 0; i < bridgePreparation.steps.length; i++) {
  const step = bridgePreparation.steps[i];

  // Batch all transactions within this step (they're all on the same chain)
  const stepBatchResult = await sendBatchTransaction({
    transactions: step.transactions,
    account,
  });

  console.log(`Step ${i + 1} batch sent:`, stepBatchResult.transactionHash);

  const receipt = await waitForReceipt({
    client,
    chain: step.transactions[0].chain,
    transactionHash: stepBatchResult.transactionHash,
  });

  console.log(`Step ${i + 1} completed:`, receipt.status);

    // Monitor bridge completion status for this step
    let bridgeStatus;
    do {
      bridgeStatus = await Bridge.status({
        transactionHash: stepBatchResult.transactionHash,
        chainId: step.transactions[0].chainId,
        client,
      });
      
      if (bridgeStatus.status === "PENDING") {
        console.log(`Bridge step ${i + 1} still pending...`);
        await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
      }
    } while (bridgeStatus.status === "PENDING");
    
    if (bridgeStatus.status === "COMPLETED") {
      console.log(`Bridge step ${i + 1} completed!`);
    } else if (bridgeStatus.status === "FAILED") {
      throw new Error(`Bridge step ${i + 1} failed`);
    }
}
```

<Callout variant="info">
  With EIP7702 smart accounts, transactions within each step execute atomically. Steps execute sequentially, ensuring proper cross-chain coordination. Gas sponsorship applies to all batched transactions.
