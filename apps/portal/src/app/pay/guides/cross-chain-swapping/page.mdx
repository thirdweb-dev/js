# Leverage Cross-Chain Swaps with Universal Bridge

Learn how to enable your users to swap from any asset to any other with thirdweb's Universal Bridge.

In this guide, we'll show you how to purchase 10 USDC on Optimism in Typescript.

---

<Steps>
<Step title='Install the Connect SDK'>
<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn add thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
/>
<Step title='Get Your Client ID'>

Log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team). Click on Create New > Project to get your **Client ID**. You'll need your Client ID to interact with the Connect SDK.

</Step>
</Step>
<Step title='Find available routes'>
Before your user can select which tokens they'd like to swap, they'll need to find available routes.

You can do this using the `routes` function in our `Bridge` namespace. You or your users can filter by origin and destination chains and/or tokens. Pagination is also built-in to the function.

```tsx
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";

// Get all available routes
const allRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// Filter routes for a specific token or chain
const filteredRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
  originChainId: 1, // From Ethereum
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // To Optimism
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// Paginate through routes
const paginatedRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0,
  client: thirdwebClient,
});
```

This will return an array of `Route` objects, which will include information such as `symbol`, `address`, and `chainId` for both the origin and destination tokens.

</Step>
<Step title='Get a quote'>
Once you know which routes are available, you can retrieve a quote to show the user how much they can expect to pay for a given swap.

In this example, we'll use the `Buy.quote` function to get a quote for buying 10 USDC on Optimism for Base ETH.

<Callout variant="info">
  The `Buy` namespace is purpose-built for when you want to obtain a specific amount of the output token.
  If you have a specific input amount and are flexible on the output amount, you can use the `Sell` namespace.
  Learn more about sells [here](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/sell/prepare).
</Callout>

Quote allows us to get an expected amount before the user has connected their wallet. This quote won't come with executable transactions, and won't be a guaranteed price.


```tsx
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";

const buyQuote = await Bridge.Buy.quote({
  originChainId: 8453, // Base
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // Optimism
  destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // Optimism USDC
  amount: 10000000n, // 10 USDC
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

console.log(
  `To get ${buyQuote.destinationAmount} wei on destination chain, you need to pay ${buyQuote.originAmount} wei`,
);
```

This will return a `Quote` object, which will include the `originAmount` and `destinationAmount` in wei, along with some more useful information about the predicted quote.
</Step>
<Step title='Get the prepared transaction'>
Now that we know how much the user can expect to pay, we can have them connect their wallet and execute the swap.

To get a prepared quote, we'll use the `Buy.prepare` function. The key difference with this function is it requires a `sender` and `receiver` to be specified.

```tsx
import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";

const preparedBuy = await Bridge.Buy.prepare({
  originChainId: 8453, // Base
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // Optimism
  destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // Optimism USDC
  amount: 10000000n, // 10 USDC
  sender: "0x2a4f24F935Eb178e3e7BA9B53A5Ee6d8407C0709", // Your user's wallet address
  receiver: "0x2a4f24F935Eb178e3e7BA9B53A5Ee6d8407C0709", // Recipient address (can be the same as sender)
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// The prepared quote contains the steps and transactions you need to execute
console.log(`Steps: ${preparedBuy.steps.length}`);
```

This will return a `PreparedQuote` object. It will look very similar to the `Quote` you received in the previous step, but it will include a `steps` array containing all the transactions you need to execute to complete the swap.
</Step>
<Step title='Execute the swap'>
To execute the swap, we'll need to send all transactions in each step one after the other. The SDK automatically includes any necessary approvals in the transactions array.

```tsx
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const preparedBuy = await Bridge.Buy.prepare({
  originChainId: 8453, // Base
  originTokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
  destinationChainId: 10, // Optimism
  destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85", // Optimism USDC
  amount: 10000000n, // 10 USDC
  sender: "0x2a4f24F935Eb178e3e7BA9B53A5Ee6d8407C0709", // Your user's wallet address
  receiver: "0x2a4f24F935Eb178e3e7BA9B53A5Ee6d8407C0709", // Recipient address (can be the same as sender)
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// Execute all transactions in sequence
for (const step of preparedBuy.steps) {
  for (const transaction of step.transactions) {
    // Handle approvals first
    if (transaction.action === "approval") {
      const result = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({ 
        transaction, 
        account: wallet.account 
      });
      console.log("Approval sent:", result.transactionHash);
    } else {
      // Execute the main swap transaction
      const result = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({ 
        transaction, 
        account: wallet.account 
      });
      console.log("Swap transaction sent:", result.transactionHash);
      
      // Wait for completion before continuing
      let swapStatus;
      do {
        swapStatus = await Bridge.status({
          transactionHash: result.transactionHash,
          chainId: transaction.chainId,
          client: thirdwebClient,
        });
        if (swapStatus.status === "PENDING") {
          await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)); // Wait 3 seconds
        }
      } while (swapStatus.status === "PENDING");
      
      if (swapStatus.status === "FAILED") {
        throw new Error("Swap transaction failed");
      }
    }
  }
}
```
<Callout variant="info">
  The transactions come pre-configured with all necessary parameters including gas estimation. Each transaction has an `action` property that indicates whether it's an "approval" or the main swap transaction.
</Callout>

</Step>
<Step title='Getting the swap status'>
You can get the status of any swap using the transaction hash and chain ID of its origin transaction.

When sending transactions in a prepared quote, you **must** use `Bridge.status` to confirm `COMPLETED` status before moving to the next transaction. This ensures both origin and destination transactions have completed successfully.

```tsx
import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

// Check the status of a bridge transaction
const bridgeStatus = await Bridge.status({
  transactionHash: "0x5959b9321ec581640db531b80bac53cbd968f3d34fc6cb1d5f4ea75f26df2ad7",
  chainId: 137, // The chain ID where the transaction was initiated
  client: thirdwebClient,
});

// The status will be one of: "COMPLETED", "PENDING", "FAILED", or "NOT_FOUND"
if (bridgeStatus.status === "COMPLETED") {
  console.log(`
    Bridge completed!
    Sent: ${bridgeStatus.originAmount} wei on chain ${bridgeStatus.originChainId}
    Received: ${bridgeStatus.destinationAmount} wei on chain ${bridgeStatus.destinationChainId}
  `);
} else if (bridgeStatus.status === "PENDING") {
  console.log("Bridge transaction is still pending...");
} else if (bridgeStatus.status === "FAILED") {
  console.log("Bridge transaction failed");
} else {
  console.log("Transaction not found");
}
```
</Step>
</Steps>
