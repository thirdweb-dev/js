# Understanding fees

Understand how protocol, developer, and onramp fees work with Universal Bridge. 

### Developer Fee

To monetize applications or games, you are able to set a developer fee on each crypto-to-crypto or swap transaction. You may set this percentage
through Project > Universal Bridge > Settings.

### Protocol Fee

Our protocol fee is a flat 30 basis points (0.30%) applied on the source token amount.
This fee is independent of network gas fees and does not fluctuate.

#### Setting fees using buy or sell

You can configure who pays the protocol fee for buy or sell transactions by specifying the input amount `sell` or `buy`.

See full reference for [`buy`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/buy/prepare) and [`sell`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/sell/prepare). 

#### Setting fees on transfers or purchase mode

You can configure who pays the protocol fee for transfers or purchase mode using the `feePayer` setting. This affects the 
total amount paid by the user and the amount received by the destination (e.g., a seller, app, or partner).

feePayer=buyer (Default) i.e. the user covers the protocol fee.

Example: If the source token is 10 USDC, the user pays 10.30 USDC.

- thirdweb receives: 0.30 USDC

- Receiver receives: 10.00 USDC

feePayer=receiver i.e. the receiver covers the protocol fee.

Example: The user pays 10.00 USDC.

- thirdweb receives: 0.30 USDC

- Receiver receives: 9.70 USDC

### Onramp Fee

When onramping to crypto using the Universal Bridge, a fee is charged by the third-party provider. This fee is determined by the provider and is typically a percentage 
of the amount being onramped. This fee may vary based on the provider and payment method used.

There are no protocol fees on onramp transactions.
