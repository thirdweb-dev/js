# Onramp Providers

**Onramp Providers** are services that allow users to buy crypto with fiat. You can set preferred providers for your application by using the [`preferredProvider`](/connect/pay/customization/payembed#preferred-provider) parameter in the `PayEmbed` component.
Universal Bridge supports the following onramp providers:

- **Coinbase**
- **Transak**
- **Stripe**

## Provider Fees

Each provider has different fees associated with their services which often depend on various factors. Onramp provider fees are set by the provider and are not controlled by thirdweb.
