<Details summary="Your card does not support this type of purchase."> 
When using onramp providers, you may encounter an error stating "There was an issue processing your payment and you have not been charged. Your card does not support this type of purchase." 

This typically means that your card issuer does not allow cryptocurrency purchases.

To work around this issue, you can try using a different card or payment method, such as debit card, if available.
