# Verify your team email domain

## Why should I verify my domain?

- Verified badge: Your team gets a special badge, so it’s easier to confirm you're in the right place.
- Recommended team members: On the Settings → Members page, you’ll see users with emails that match your domain but aren’t in the team yet — making it super easy to invite everyone on the team.
- Instant invite alerts: Team owners will get a notification (in the dashboard and optionally via email) when someone signs up with your verified domain — with a 1-click invite option.

## How to verify your domain

1. Navigate to [Team Settings](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/settings) and look for *Domain Verification*.
1. Enter your domain name.
  - Your domain name is the part after the `@` symbol in your company email address. It is NOT a website and should not contain `https://` nor `www`.
1. You should see instructions to add a `TXT record` on your domain to complete verification.
  - Type: TXT
  - Name/Host: `_tw-<YOUR_TEAM_ID>.<YOUR_DOMAIN>`
  - Value: `tw-verify=<YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE>`
  - See below for provider-specific instructions.

thirdweb will automatically detect the TXT record once it's live. DNS changes may take several hours to update.
Check this dashboard page periodically to confirm when it's completed.

### Verify your TXT record

Use a tool like [MxToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/txtlookup.aspx) or `dig` in the command line to check if your TXT record is correct.

```bash
$ dig +short -t txt _tw-<TEAM_ID>.<YOUR_DOMAIN> 

# If correct, you should see this response:
"tw-verify=<YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE>"
```
