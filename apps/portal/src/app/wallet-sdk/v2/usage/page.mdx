# Usage

Now you'rr ready to use any of the [supported wallets](/wallet-sdk/v2#wallets).

## Usage with TypeScript SDK

You can [initialize the thirdweb TypeScript SDK](/v4/getting-started#initialize-the-sdk) using a wallet using the `fromWallet` method.

```ts
// 1. Import the wallet you want to use from the package
import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";

// 2. Instantiate the wallet class
const coinbaseWallet = new CoinbaseWallet();

// 3. Connect to the wallet (prompts the user when required)
const walletAddress = await coinbaseWallet.connect();

// Instantiate the SDK using the wallet
const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, "ethereum", {
	clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID", // Use client id if using on the client side, get it from dashboard settings
	secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY", // Use secret key if using on the server, get it from dashboard settings
});
```

## Usage with other SDKs

thirdweb's React, React Native, and Unity SDKs uses this package internally and offers a higher level abstraction for connecting these wallets. Refer to the documentation below to see how to connect wallets in these SDKs
