# Proxy Contracts

A Proxy smart contract contains the [Storage](/storage) for an upgradable contract that allows you to modify its logic post-deployment.

A smart contract is made up of (1) persistent state/storage, and (2) logic defined for how this state can be mutated. Upgrading a smart contract means changing the logic defined for how the smart contract’s state can be mutated.

An “upgradeable smart contract” is two smart contracts considered together as one system:

1. **Proxy smart contract**: The smart contract whose state/storage we’re concerned with.
2. **Implementation smart contract**: A stateless smart contract that defines the logic for how the proxy smart contract’s state can be mutated.

To _upgrade_ the smart contract, simply deploy a new implementation contract and call the upgrade function on the proxy contract to _upgrade_ to the new implementation.
