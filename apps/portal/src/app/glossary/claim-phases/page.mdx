# Claim Phases

Claim phases or "claim conditions" allow you to configure various aspects of a [drop](/glossary/drop); such as who can claim tokens,
how many tokens will be released, the price of each token, release date, etc.

They are available to use for any smart contract that implements the [Drop Single Phase](/contracts/build/extensions/general/DropSinglePhase)
or [Drop](/contracts/build/extensions/general/Drop) extension smart contracts, which includes our ready-to-deploy smart contracts like the
[NFT Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721), [Token Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC20), and [Edition Drop](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC1155) smart contracts.
