# IPFS

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a protocol to store files in a decentralized peer-to-peer network.

Storing information on the blockchain is expensive and comes with significant size limitations,
IPFS provides a way to store files in a decentralized manner _not_ on the blockchain, sometimes referred to as "off-chain" storage.

To secure content on IPFS forever, a node must [pin](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/persistence/) the content, otherwise, it may be discarded and therefore made unavailable.
[Learn more about how IPFS works](https://ipfs.tech/#how).

To read data from IPFS, an [IPFS Gateway](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/ipfs-gateway/) is required. This allows you to access data from the IPFS protocol on browsers and other HTTP clients, such
as when building an application using our [SDK](/contracts/interact/overview).

Out of the box, all of our tools use [Storage](/storage) to store, pin, and retrieve data from IPFS via a gateway, currently powered by [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud/) under the hood.
