# Signature-based Minting

Signature-based minting, or "on-demand minting" allows a smart contract admin to generate signatures
that can be used by other wallets to allow them to mint tokens on your smart contract in real-time.

This allows you to conditionally generate signatures based on some condition/criteria, or allow a user to mint
NFTs with metadata that you specify. Enabling use cases such as:

- [Allowing NFT holders to mint for free](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/signature-drop/)
- [Creating a community-made NFT collection](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/mint-nft-unique-code/)
- [Restricted mints to users who are GitHub contributors](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/allow-github-contributors-to-mint-an-nft/)
- [Restricted mints to Discord members](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/community-rewards)
