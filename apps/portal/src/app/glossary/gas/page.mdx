# Gas Fees

All transactions (operations that change information stored on the blockchain) require a gas fee,
which is used to cover the costs of the computational resources to execute that transaction.

Gas fees are typically paid in the currency that is native to the blockchain you are interacting with. For example, if you are using the Ethereum blockchain, you will need to pay gas fees in Ether.

While using thirdweb is free, you will need to cover the cost of performing actions that update the blockchain's state.

This includes actions performed via the thirdweb [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard), our [SDKs](/contracts/interact/overview), or any of our other products, including:

- Deploying smart contracts
- [Lazy-minting](/glossary/lazy-minting) the metadata of your NFTs
- Updating permissions on your smart contracts
- Setting [claim phases](/glossary/claim-phases)
