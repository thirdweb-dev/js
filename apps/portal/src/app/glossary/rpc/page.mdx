# RPC URLs

An RPC (Remote Procedure Call) URL
is an endpoint that enables an application to communicate with a blockchain network.
It is used to send requests (initiate transactions) and receive responses (read data) from the blockchain,
enabling developers to build applications that interact with the blockchain.

Out of the box, we provide free [RPC URLs](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/rpc) for all supported blockchains, including All EVM-compatible networks.
