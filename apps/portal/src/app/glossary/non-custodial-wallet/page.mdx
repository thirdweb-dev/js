# Non-Custodial Wallet

A non-custodial wallet (also known as a self-custody wallet) is a wallet where the user has full control of their security & assets.
The user is solely responsible for the security of their private key and therefore their funds.
Examples of non-custodial wallets are Coinbase Wallet, Electron, and Ledger.
