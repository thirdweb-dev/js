# Minting

Minting is the process of creating new tokens on the blockchain. These tokens can be any type of asset, such as ERC-20, ERC-721 or ERC-1155 tokens.
Minting is usually done by the creator of the token (the default admin), but can also be done by anyone who has been given [permission](/contracts/build/extensions/general/Permissions) to mint tokens by the creator.

Minting is enabled on contracts that implement a `mint` function.
