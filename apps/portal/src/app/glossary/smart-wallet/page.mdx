# Smart Account

A Smart Account is a wallet that is controlled by a smart contract following the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

Ethereum has 2 types of accounts to transfer and receive tokens: EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) and Contract Accounts. A smart contract wallet is a wallet managed by a contract account
instead of an EOA. A smart account is a wallet type requiring **no private keys or seed phrases**.
Smart contract wallets rely on code instead of private keys to secure and recover wallet information.
Instead, you set _who_ and _under what conditions_, users may access the wallet via smart contracts.

**A smart contract wallet is a type of Web3 wallet powered by smart contracts.**

This smart account is unlocked by a 'key' - a personal account. This key can be anything from a [MetaMask](/references/wallets/v2/MetaMaskWallet) wallet or even a [Local Wallet](/references/wallets/v2/LocalWallet) and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the wallet.

Benefits of Smart Accounts:

1. Optimized transaction efficiency & batch transactions
   - Combine multiple transactions into a single transaction to save on [gas fees](/glossary/gas)
2. Improved Security Features
3. Social & Multi-Sig Recovery
   - Recover a wallet without seed phrases/passwords
   - Nominate a trusted person to recover your wallet in the case of an emergency

## Terminology

### UserOperations

This is the data structure for the transaction that the user wants to perform. It contains the following fields:

- `sender`: The account making the operation.
- `nonce`: Anti-replay parameter; also used as the salt for first-time account creation.
- `initCode`: The initialization code needed to create the account (needed if and only if the account is not yet onchain).
- `callData`: The data to pass to the `sender` during the operation.
- `callGasLimit`: The amount of gas to allocate for the operation.
- `verificationGasLimit`: The amount of gas to allocate for the verification step.
- `preVerificationGas`: The amount of gas to pay for to compensate the bundler for pre-verification execution and calldata.
- `maxFeePerGas`: Maximum fee per gas (similar to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) `max_fee_per_gas`).
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Maximum priority fee per gas (similar to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)).
- `paymasterAndData`: Address of paymaster sponsoring the transaction, followed by extra data to send to the paymaster (empty for self-sponsored transaction).
- `signature`: Data passed into the account along with the nonce during the verification step. Should depend on the `chainid` and `EntryPoint` address to prevent replay attacks.

### EntryPoint

The EntryPoint is a singleton contract (a contract that has a predictable address that is the same on every chain).
It has two methods that are used as entry points to execute bundles of UserOperations: `handleOps` and `handleAggregatedOps`.

### Bundler (relayer)

A bundler is a smart contract that bundles multiple 'UserOperations' into a single bundle, a `handleOps` call, to the `EntryPoint` contract.

### Paymaster

A paymaster is a smart contract that relays transactions. It provides a service that enables a third party to pay
the transaction fee on behalf of the user by funding the paymaster in advance. The Paymaster acts as a gas reserve which then
can be used during the call execution via `EntryPoint`. The thirdweb [Account ABstraction](/connect/account-abstraction) paymaster is initially paid for by thirdweb. By using an API key,
the usage is tracked and billed.
