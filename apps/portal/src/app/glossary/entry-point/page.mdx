# Entry Point

The EntryPoint is a singleton contract (a contract that has a predictable address that is the same on every chain and only one instance per chain).
It has two methods that are used as entry points to execute bundles of UserOperations: `handleOps` and `handleAggregatedOps` which validate and execute user operation(s).
