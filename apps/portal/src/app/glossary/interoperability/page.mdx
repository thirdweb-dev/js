# Interoperability

Interoperability refers to the ability of different networks to share data or assets (like tokens) and interact with each other.

For example, if Blockchain A is interoperable with Blockchain B, it means that a user could send tokens from Blockchain A to Blockchain B in a way that's secure and verifiable on both chains.
