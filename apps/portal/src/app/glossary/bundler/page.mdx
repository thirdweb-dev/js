# Bundler

A bundler is a node that monitors the alternative mempool of `UserOperations` and bundles multiple `UserOps` together to forward to the EntryPoint contract as a single transaction.
These `UserOps` can be sent from different accounts and are bundled and sent to the `EntryPoint` contract via a `handleOps` call.

The bundler is controlled by its own EOA which initially pays for the gas fees upfront and is then repaid by either the sender or a paymaster if the transaction is sponsored.

The entry point contract then uses the `validateOp` and `executeOp` functions on the smart account contract to verify and execute the `UserOps` on behalf of the users.

It allows you to send transactions with smart accounts.
