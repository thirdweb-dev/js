# Smart Contract

A smart contract is a computer program, stored on the blockchain.
Smart contracts allow trustless transactions to be executed without third parties - the smart contract enforces the rules of the transaction automatically.
These transactions are trackable and irreversible.

Key features of smart contracts are:

- **Autonomous**: Once a smart contract is initiated, it can act by itself without further participant involvement.

- **Decentralized**: No single party has control over the entirety of the contract, and it cannot be modified after deployment.

- **Deterministic**: Outcomes can be determined from the inputs and the contract code.
