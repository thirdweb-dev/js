# Drop

A drop smart contract allows the owner of the contract to [lazy mint](/glossary/lazy-minting) NFTs _(unless it is an ERC20 drop)_,
and have other users mint them, typically under the conditions defined in the smart contract&rsquo;s [claim phases](/glossary/claim-phases), although these are not required.

This is a common pattern for projects that want their community to be able to claim tokens:

1. The contract owner defines the metadata for the tokens:

   - For NFTs, this means they [lazy mint](/glossary/lazy-minting) the NFTs by providing the metadata for each NFT.
   - For ERC20 tokens, the token metadata is defined when the contract is deployed.

2. The contract owner defines how user&rsquo;s can claim the tokens, optionally configuring [claim phases](/glossary/claim-phases).

3. Users can claim tokens by calling the `claim` function on the contract, which will mint the tokens to the user&rsquo;s address.
