# Paymaster

A paymaster is a smart contract that relays transactions.
It provides a service that enables a third party to pay the transaction fee on behalf
of the user by funding the paymaster in advance.
The Paymaster acts as a gas reserve which then can be used during the call execution via the
`EntryPoint` contract.

The thirdweb paymaster is initially paid for by thirdweb.
By using an [API key](/api-keys), the usage is tracked and billed.
