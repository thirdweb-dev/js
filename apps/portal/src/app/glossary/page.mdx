| [Claim phases](/glossary/claim-phases)                         | Claim phases or "claim conditions" allow you to configure various aspects of a drop; such as who can claim tokens, how many tokens will be released, the price of each token, release date, etc.                                                                                                   |
| [Claiming](/glossary/claiming)                                 | Claiming is the process of transferring token ownership to the claimer's wallet..                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| [Delayed reveal](/glossary/delayed-reveal)                     | Delayed reveal is a feature that allows you to release NFTs in a drop with hidden content that can only be revealed at a later time. The owner of the smart contract (or a wallet with the appropriate permissions) can lazy-mint a batch of NFTs, along with placeholder metadata and a password. |
| [Drop](/glossary/drop)                                         | A drop smart contract allows the owner of the contract to lazy mint NFTs (unless it is an ERC20 drop), and have other users mint them, typically under the conditions defined in the smart contractâ€™s claim phases, although these are not required.                                               |

| [Gasless Transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions)         | Gasless transactions, also known as meta-transactions, are transactions that have the gas fee paid for by a third party instead of the transaction sender.
