# Lazy Minting

Lazy minting is the preparation of NFT metadata without actually minting the NFT to a wallet address.

This is a useful process for smart contract admins who want to prepare metadata for NFTs that will be minted by other wallets in a [drop](/glossary/drop),
_without_ paying the [gas cost](/glossary/gas) to mint those NFTs.

The typical process for lazy minting is:

1. Contract admin lazy-mints NFT metadata (either in bulk or for individual NFTs).
2. Contract admin defines how NFTs can be minted using [claim phases](/glossary/claim-phases).
3. Other wallets mint NFTs by claiming them. When they claim, they pay the gas cost to mint the NFT and the NFT is minted to their wallet address.
