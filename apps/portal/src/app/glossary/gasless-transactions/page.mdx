# Gasless Transactions

Gasless Transactions, also known as meta-transactions, are transactions that have the [gas fee](/glossary/gas)
paid for by a third party instead of the transaction sender.
Typically, this means the dApp owner covers the gas costs of their users' transactions, providing a more seamless user experience.

This works by having the user sign a message that is then sent to a relayer, which pays the gas fee and forwards the transaction to the blockchain.

You can attract a broader audience by removing the need to have gas to use your application. Engine offers multiple options for developers looking to sponsor gas for their users' transactions.
