# Permissionless

On the context of smart contracts, permissionless means that anyone can interact with the contract without needing special permission or approval.
Smart contracts can be deployed on public blockchains like Ethereum,
promoting open access and transparency. While anyone can interact with a permissionless smart contract,
the contract's code may still limit certain operations (like modifying the contract or accessing certain data)
to specific roles, such as the contract's owner or creator.
