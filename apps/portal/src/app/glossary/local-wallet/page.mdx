# Local Wallet

A local wallet is a type of wallet that allows you to create wallets within your application or project.

It is a non-custodial solution that simplifies the onboarding process by offering a "checkout as guest" experience.
This improves the user experience for web3 apps in two ways:

1. It enables non-web3 native users to get started easily without having to create a wallet with an external provider like MetaMask.
2. It hides transaction confirmations from users. With a local wallet, you can generate wallets on the backend,
   and each app can have one wallet that is app-scoped.
