# Production Checklist

Before deploying Engine to production, ensure you have completed the following steps.

- [ ] Ensure access tokens are not accessible from your frontend. The Engine API is intended to be called from your backend only. 

  **Exception: Relayer endpoints do not require access tokens.**

- [ ] Securely store access tokens, vault admin keys, and your project's secret key. You may use a tool such as AWS Secrets Manager, Google Secrets Manager, and others. 
- [ ] Use labels to keep track of your wallets, admins, and access tokens.
- [ ] Use access token with expirations to grant time-bound access.

After deploying Engine to production, ensure you check regularly to keep your setup secure.
- [ ] Regularly review the admins list to remove inactive and former team members.
- [ ] Rotate credentials such as access tokens, admin keys, and your project's secret key if they have been compromised.
- [ ] Ensure your server wallets have sufficient funds. Use [wallet webhooks](/engine/v2/features/webhooks) to alert when your gas balance is low.

## Recommended Actions

- Use a wallet backed by AWS KMS or Google KMS. Wallet access is always recoverable and your wallet's private keys are never exposed.
- If using a local wallet: **back up the private key**. Engine cannot recover private keys if the encrypted stored data is lost or corrupted.
