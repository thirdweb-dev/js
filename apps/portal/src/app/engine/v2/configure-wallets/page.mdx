# Configure Engine Wallets

Engine performs blockchain actions using server wallets that you own and manage.

### Smart Server Wallets

Smart server wallets are the **recommended option** to perform blockchain actions with Engine.

**Benefits:**
- Eliminate manual gas management. Smart server wallets are automatically funded via your thirdweb-linked payment method using a built-in paymaster.
- Smart accounts use multi-dimensional nonces, which are more efficient than EOAs.
- Works with all existing Engine endpoints without needing any code changes.
- Secured non-custodially through Vault, thirdweb's key management system. 

Smart server wallets are included with Engine Cloud and Engine Dedicated. [Learn how to configure your own smart server wallets.](/engine/v2/configure-wallets/server-wallets)

### Secure and import your own EOA

For users wanting to use their own wallets, we recommend securing your wallet with a key management service such as [AWS KMS](/engine/v2/configure-wallets/aws-kms) or [Google Cloud KMS](/engine/v2/configure-wallets/gcp-kms).

**Benefits:**
- Import your own existing wallets and use them with Engine.

Importing secured EOAs through AWS KMS or Google are included in the Engine Dedicated plan. 
### Circle Programmable Wallets

Circle Programmable Wallets is a Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution designed to simplify the creation and management of secure Web3 wallets and their private keys. 

### Configuration Types

- `smart:local` - Smart account backed by a local key
- `smart:aws-kms` - Smart account backed by AWS KMS
- `smart:gcp-kms` - Smart account backed by Google Cloud KMS
- `smart:circle` - Smart account backed by Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets

## Best practices

- Using AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets is recommended for securing wallets for production use. Private keys are never exposed and the wallet is backed up securely by the cloud provider.
- Use labels and multiple server wallets to organize and track usage. Example: Use one wallet to pay out creators on your platform and another to airdrop NFTs to users.
- If using your own wallets require topping up gas or ERC20 tokens regularly, consider creating separate "funds storage" backend wallet that transfers funds to other wallets via the dashboard UI or API.
