# Smart Server Wallets

Smart server wallets are the recommended way to perform blockchain operations with Engine. Each smart server wallet consists of an EOA (managed internally by Engine) and a smart account (using thirdweb's default account implementation).

### Benefits

Smart server wallets inherit smart account benefits and offer several advantages over traditional EOAs:

- **Gas Management**: Built-in paymaster eliminates the need to maintain gas tokens. This means you never need to hold crypto or top up gas.
- **Better Nonce Management**: Smart accounts use multi-dimensional nonces, which are more efficient than EOAs.
- **Simple Integration**: Works with all existing Engine endpoints without any code changes.

### How it works

The smart account is automatically deployed the first time you send a transaction on a chain. You don't need to think about deploying or managing the smart account - Engine handles everything behind the scenes. All transactions are sent as UserOperations to the EntryPoint contract on chain.

<Details summary="How are Smart Backend Wallets different from existing engine AA features?">
	Unlike the [previous account abstraction implementation in
	Engine](account-abstraction) where you had to manage both the account address
	(`x-account-address`) and the backend wallet address
	(`x-backend-wallet-address`) separately, smart backend wallets simplify this.
	The backend wallet address is now the smart account address itself.
</Details>

<Details summary="When not to use Smart Backend Wallets?">
	At this time, Smart Backend Wallets do not allow for importing a smart
	account. In use cases where you need to import a smart account (such as with
	session keys), you should use [Engine AA features that utilise the
	`x-account-address` header](account-abstraction).
</Details>

### Pricing

Smart server wallets have no additional costs to use with your Engine instance. Transactions sent from smart backend wallets follow the same billing model as regular account abstraction transactions with thirdweb.
Smart accounts need to be deployed on each chain. This costs gas and is billed to your account like any other transaction.
