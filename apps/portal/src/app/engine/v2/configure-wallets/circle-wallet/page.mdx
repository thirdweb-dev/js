## Circle Wallet

[Circle Programmable Wallets](https://developers.circle.com/w3s/programmable-wallets) is a Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution designed to simplify the creation and management of secure Web3 wallets and their private keys. Engine can create and transact with the wallet, but not delete it.

<Callout variant="info" title="Circle Wallets">
    Circle wallets are not currently supported on Engine Cloud. They are currently supported on Engine Dedicated v2, and will be available soon with Dedicated v3.
</Callout>

#### Setup

1. Create a Circle account at the [Circle Console](https://console.circle.com/signin).
2. Navigate to [API & Client Keys](https://console.circle.com/api-keys).
3. Create an API Key. (Either a standard key or a restricted key scoped to "Programmable Wallets" is required.) Do not enable the IP Allowlist. Store this key, it is not shown again.
4. In the dashboard, navigate to **Configuration > Server Wallets**.
5. Select **Circle** and provide the following:
   - API Key (example: `API_KEY:...`)

<Callout variant="info" title="Circle API Key">
	Circle API Keys are scoped to either Testnet or Mainnet. Server wallets
	created with a testnet key will not work on the mainnet, and vice versa
	<br /> If you want to change between testnet and mainnet, you will need to
	update the API key configuration in engine, and recreate a wallet with the
	Mainnet scope.
