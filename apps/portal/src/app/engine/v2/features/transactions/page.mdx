# Engine Transactions

Blockchain **read** calls (e.g. get token balance) are synchronous and will return the value read.

Blockchain **write** calls (e.g. transfer tokens) are asynchronous:

- Your app backend sends a write transaction to Engine.
- Engine enqueues the job and returns a reference to the job: `queueId`.
  - If `queueId` is returned, this transaction will be attempted.
  - If `queueId` is not returned, this transaction failed to be added to the queue and will not be attempted.
- Engine will attempt to submit the transaction from your specified backend wallet.
  - If there is an error (failed simulation, out of gas), the transaction is set to `errored` and will not be re-attempted.
- Engine polls to check if the transaction is mined. If it is, the transaction is set to `mined`.
- If the transaction is not mined after some duration, Engine re-submits the transaction with aggressive gas settings. This transaction is sent with the same nonce and will be mined at most once.

## Learn what each transaction status means

- **Queued**: The transaction was received by Engine and waiting in the transaction queue.
- **Sent**: The transaction was successfully sent to RPC.
- **Mined**: The transaction was successfully mined onchain.
- **Cancelled**: The transaction was cancelled by the user.
- **Errored**: The transaction failed to be sent to RPC or to the chain's nodes. This can happen for many reasons (malformed transaction, failed simulation, too low gas).

## Cancelling Transactions

Engine submits transactions to the blockchain within 5-10 seconds of receiving a request. During gas or traffic spikes, transactions may take longer to be mined.

In some cases, your application may want to cancel the transaction, such as:

- The transaction was sent in error.
- An NFT collection's supply has run out.
- The transaction's exchange rate has changed and should be re-attempted with a new exchange rate.

When Engine receives a cancellation request:

- If the transaction is completed (mined, errored, or canceled), this endpoint returns an error.
- If the transaction is already submitted to RPC, this endpoint sends a no-op transaction with aggressive gas options to "replace" the original transaction.
- If the transaction is not yet submitted, this endpoint will remove it from the queue.

**When canceled, the transaction will not be re-attempted.** Your backend may safely re-attempt this transaction.

## Cancel a transaction from the API

```typescript
// queueId was returned from a previous write request.

const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/transaction/cancel", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
		Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({ queueId }),
});
if (resp.status === 200) {
	console.log(`Transaction ${queueId} was canceled.`);
}
```

## Cancel a transaction from the dashboard

Select the **Cancel** icon next to a queued transaction in the Tranasctions table.
