# Relayers

Use Engine as a relayer to sponsor gas for transactions on behalf of your users. Users sign a transaction with their own wallet (no gas required), and pay [gas fees](/glossary/gas) with an Engine backend wallet.

Removing the need for your users to get gas greatly improves the user experience and reach of your dApp.

## Use cases

Enable users to claim, transfer, list, or burn NFTs with no gas. [Learn more about gasless transactions.](/glossary/gasless-transactions)

## Requirements

- Your Engine instance has a [backend wallet](/engine/v2/features/backend-wallets) with funds.
- The target contract must support one of:
  - [EIP-2771 meta transactions](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2771) \*
  - [EIP-2612 permit approval](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)
  - [Polygon meta transactions](https://docs.polygon.technology/pos/concepts/transactions/meta-transactions/)

\*The target contract must trust a forwarder that implements the `verify` and `execute` methods, like thirdweb's default forwarder (0xd04f98c88ce1054c90022ee34d566b9237a1203c).

## Allow calls to Engine from your domain (CORS)

1. Native to [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine) and select your Engine instance.
1. Navigate to the **Configuration** section.
1. Under **Allowlisted Domains**, enter your application domain(s).
   - Include local or development environments for testing.

<Callout variant='warning' title="The relay endpoint is unauthenticated.">

Set **Allowed Contracts** and **Allowed Forwarders** to restrict transactions your relayer allows.

</Callout>

## Create a relayer

1. Navigate to [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine) and select your Engine instance.
1. Navigate to the **Explorer** section.
1. Select **Add relayer**.
1. Provide the following details:
   - **Chain**: The chain where contracts will be called.
   - **Backend Wallet**: The backend wallet that will submit meta-transactions to the forwarder. Ensure this wallet has sufficient gas funds.
   - **Label**: A descriptive name for this relayer.
   - **Allowed Contracts**: (Optional) A list of contract addresses this relayer is allowed to submit transactions to.
   - **Allowed Forwarders**: (Optional) A list of forwarder addresses this relayer is allowed to submit transactions to.

The relayer will be assigned a URL in this format: `https://<engine_url>/relayer/<relayer_id>`

## Submit a meta transaction from your app frontend

Use the [TypeScript SDK]](/react) to prompt the user to sign transactions and send it this relayer.

First wrap your app with `<ThirdwebProvider>`:

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

<ThirdwebProvider>
	<YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

Next prompt the user to connect a wallet. See [ConnectButton](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButton) for customization options.

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

<ConnectButton client={client} />;
```

This example will call the `claim` method on an [NFT Drop contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop):

```solidity
function claim(address _receiver, uint256 _quantity, address _currency, uint256 _pricePerToken, AllowlistProof calldata _allowlistProof, bytes memory _data)
```

Render a `<TransactionButton>` to prepare a transaction to be relayed via Engine.

```tsx
import { TransactionButton } from "thirdweb/react";

<TransactionButton
	transaction={() => {
		const contract = getContract({
			client,
			chain,
			address: NFT_ADDRESS,
		});

		return prepareContractCall({
			contract,
			method: resolveMethod("claim"),
			params: [
				// receiver
				account.address,
				// quantity
				1n,
				// currency
				NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
				// pricePerToken
				0n,
				// allowlistProof
				{
					proof: [],
					quantityLimitPerWallet: 0n,
					pricePerToken: 0n,
					currency: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
				},
				// data
				"0x",
			],
		});
	}}
	onTransactionSent={(result) =>
		console.log("Submitted:", result.transactionHash)
	}
	onTransactionConfirmed={(receipt) =>
		console.log("Confirmed:", receipt.transactionHash)
	}
	onError={(error) => console.error("Error:", error)}
	gasless={{
		provider: "engine",
		relayerUrl: RELAYER_URL, // e.g. https://<engine_url>/relayer/<relayer_id>
		relayerForwarderAddress: FORWARDER_ADDRESS, // a trusted forwarder on the contract
	}}
>
	Claim
</TransactionButton>;
```

## Submit a meta transaction from your app backend (Advanced)

Alternatively submit transactions to your relayer from your backend. This approach allows you to apply server-side validation or business logic before submitting the transaction to be relayed.

1.  Prompt the user to sign a transaction.
    - This step does not require gas.
    - The signature must match the format that the forwarder expects.
1.  Call your backend with this signature.
1.  Call Engine from your backend: `POST https://<engine_url>/relayer/{relayer_id}`

    <Details id="relayer-body-payload" summary="Body payload">

        ```typescript
        {
        	type: "forward";
        	request: {
        		chainid?: string | undefined;
        		from: string;
        		to: string;
        		value: string;
        		gas: string;
        		nonce: string;
        		data: string;
        	};
        	signature: string;
        	forwarderAddress: string;
        } | {
        	type: "permit";
        	request: {
        		to: string;
        		owner: string;
        		spender: string;
        		value: string;
        		nonce: string;
        		deadline: string;
        	};
        	signature: string;
        } | {
        	type: "execute-meta-transaction";
        	request: {
        		from: string;
        		to: string;
        		data: string;
        	};
        	signature: string;
        }
        ```
