# Get Started

Once you have Engine set up, learn the basics of Engine.

## Learn how transactions work

Blockchain **read** calls (e.g. get token balance) are synchronous and will return the value read.

Blockchain **write** calls (e.g. transfer tokens) are asynchronous:

- Your app backend sends a write transaction to Engine.
- Engine enqueues the job and returns a reference to the job: `queueId`.
  - If `queueId` is returned, this transaction will be attempted.
  - If `queueId` is not returned, this transaction failed to be added to the queue and will not be attempted.
- Engine will attempt to submit the transaction from your specified backend wallet.
  - If there is an error (failed simulation, out of gas), the transaction is set to `errored` and will not be re-attempted.
- Engine polls to check if the transaction is mined. If it is, the transaction is set to `mined`.
- If the transaction is not mined after some duration, Engine re-submits the transaction with aggressive gas settings. This transaction is sent with the same nonce and will be mined at most once.

## Manage Engine from the dashboard

<Callout variant='info' title="Check if Engine is set up">

Tip: Navigate to your Engine URL. You should see the following response: `Engine is set up successfully.`

</Callout>

Navigate to the [thirdweb Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine) to manage your Engine instances.

**Overview**

- View your backend wallets.
- Create a backend wallet.
- View recent transactions.
- View transaction details (e.g. error messages, gas used).
- Cancel a queued transaction.

**Explorer**

- Interactively view and call your Engine API.

**Relayer**

- View relayers.
- Add or remove relayers.

**Configuration**

- Change backend wallet types.
- View webhooks.
- Add and remove webhooks.

**Permissions**

- View admin users.
- Add and remove admin users.
- View access tokens.
- Create and revoke access tokens.

## Manage permissions

Engine endpoints require authentication.

- Add other **admins** for other users to manage Engine from the dashboard.
- Create **access tokens** for your backends to call the Engine API. _These are secrets that should be stored securely._
- Revoke permissions at any time.

Learn more about [admins](/engine/features/admins) and [access tokens](/engine/features/access-tokens).

## Create backend wallets

**Backend wallet** are your wallets managed by Engine. Engine will send blockchain transactions from these wallets.

- Configure how to back up wallets.
- Create or import a backend wallet.
- Specify the backend wallet to use when calling the Engine API.

## Interact with the blockchain

Here are a few example API calls.

<Callout variant='info'>

Tip: Use the [TypeScript SDK](/engine/references/typescript) for type-safety.

</Callout>

### Get a wallet's balance

```ts
const resp = await fetch(
	"<engine_url>/backend-wallet/<chain>/<backend_wallet_address>/get-balance",
	{
		headers: {
			Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
		},
	},
);

const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("Balance:", result.value);
```

### Read from a contract

This code example does not require gas funds and returns the function result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch(
	"<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/read?functionName=balanceOf&args=0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
	{
		headers: {
			Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
		},
	},
);

const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("ERC-20 balance:", result);
```

### Write to a contract

This code example calls a write method on a contract. It requires gas funds and returns a `queueId` to query for the result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch(
	"<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/write",
	{
		method: "POST",
		headers: {
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
			Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
			"x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			functionName: "transferFrom",
			args: [
				"0x1946267d81Fb8aDeeEa28e6B98bcD446c8248473",
				"0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
				"0",
			],
		}),
	},
);

const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);
```

### Deploy a contract

This code example deploys a [thirdweb NFT drop contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/DropERC721). It requires gas funds and returns a `queueId` to query for the result.

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/deploy/<chain>/prebuilts/nft-drop", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
		Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
		"x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		contractMetadata: {
			name: "thirdweb Engine example",
			symbol: "eng",
			primary_sale_recipient: "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
		},
	}),
});

const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);
```

Engine can enable your application to airdrop NFTs, send funds between wallets, update onchain game state, and more.

### Check the status of a transaction

```ts
const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>", {
	method: "GET",
	headers: {
		Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
	},
});

const { result } = await resp.json();
// status can be: processed, queued, sent, errored, mined, cancelled, retried
const isComplete = ["mined", "errored", "cancelled"].includes(result.status);
```

## Configure webhooks

Get notified when a transaction is mined, in addition to other wallet and transaction events.

- Navigate to the **Webhooks** tab on the Engine dashboard.
- Create a new webhook URL.
