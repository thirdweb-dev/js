Manage Engine from the dashboard
Check if Engine is set up
Tip: Navigate to your Engine URL. You should see the following response: Engine is set up successfully.

Navigate to the thirdweb Engine dashboard to manage your Engine instances.

Overview

View your backend wallets.
Create a backend wallet.
View recent transactions.
View transaction details (e.g. error messages, gas used).
Cancel a queued transaction.
Explorer

Interactively view and call your Engine API.
Relayer

Manage permissions
Engine endpoints require authentication.

Add other admins for other users to manage Engine from the dashboard.
Create access tokens for your backends to call the Engine API. These are secrets that should be stored securely.
Revoke permissions at any time.
Learn more about admins and access tokens.

Create backend wallets
Backend wallet are your wallets managed by Engine. Engine will send blockchain transactions from these wallets.

Configure how to back up wallets.
Create or import a backend wallet.
Specify the backend wallet to use when calling the Engine API.
Learn more about backend wallets.

Interact with the blockchain
Here are a few example API calls.

Tip: Use the TypeScript SDK for type-safety.

Get a wallet's balance
const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/backend-wallet/<chain>/<backend_wallet_address>/get-balance",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    },
  },
);
 
const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("Balance:", result.value);

Read from a contract
This code example does not require gas funds and returns the function result.

const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/read?functionName=balanceOf&args=0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
  {
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    },
  },
);
 
const { result } = await resp.json();
console.log("ERC-20 balance:", result);

Write to a contract
This code example calls a write method on a contract. It requires gas funds and returns a queueId to query for the result.

const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/contract/<chain>/<contract_address>/write",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
      "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      functionName: "transferFrom",
      args: [
        "0x1946267d81Fb8aDeeEa28e6B98bcD446c8248473",
        "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
        "0",
      ],
    }),
  },
);
 
const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);

Deploy a contract
This code example deploys a thirdweb NFT drop contract. It requires gas funds and returns a queueId to query for the result.

const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/deploy/<chain>/prebuilts/nft-drop",
  {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
      "x-backend-wallet-address": "<backend_wallet_address>",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      contractMetadata: {
        name: "thirdweb Engine example",
        symbol: "eng",
        primary_sale_recipient:
          "0x3EcDBF3B911d0e9052b64850693888b008e18373",
      },
    }),
  },
);
 
const { result } = await resp.json();
// queueId is a reference to the transaction queued by Engine.
console.log("Queue ID:", result.queueId);

Engine can enable your application to airdrop NFTs, send funds between wallets, update onchain game state, and more.

Check the status of a transaction
const resp = await fetch(
  "<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>",
  {
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
    },
  },
);
 
const { result } = await resp.json();
// status can be: processed, queued, sent, errored, mined, cancelled, retried
const isComplete = ["mined", "errored", "cancelled"].includes(
  result.status,
);

Configure webhooks
Get notified when a transaction is mined, in addition to other wallet and transaction events.

Navigate to the Webhooks tab on the Engine dashboard.
Create a new webhook URL.
