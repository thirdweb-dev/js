# Transactions FAQs

<Details summary="How is pricing calculated?">
Pricing is calculated through the number of write requests (ex: /v1/write/contract) and sign requests (ex: /v1/sign/transaction) made through the Transactions API. For requests costs, [see the thirdweb pricing page](https://thirdweb.com/pricing). Read requests made through Transactions API are free, within the RPC limits/plan. 

For requests through server wallets paid through the user's thirdweb account, users will pay a 5% premium on the gas fee of each request completed on any mainnet as part of account abstraction fees. There are no gas charges for testnets.

**Please note: Legacy pricing plans may be subject to the 10% fee specified when signed up instead of 5%. [See pricing page for updated plans and benefits](https://thirdweb.com/pricing)** 

The breakdown for usage and transaction fees can be found in your usage dashboard under the team overview.

<Details summary="What is the difference between Transactions Cloud and Dedicated?">
Cloud uses shared infrastructure that allows you to get started quickly with Transactions. It is ideal for most use cases and is the recommended way to use Transactions.

Dedicated is a self-hosted version of Transactions that allows you to run Transactions on your own infrastructure. 

It is ideal for high throughput applications, or applications that require complete control over their infrastructure.
