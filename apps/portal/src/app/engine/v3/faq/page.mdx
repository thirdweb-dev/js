# Engine FAQs

<Details summary="How is pricing calculated for Engine Cloud?">
Pricing is calculated through the number of write requests (ex: /v1/write/contract) and sign requests (ex: /v1/sign/transaction) made through the Engine API. Write and sign requests cost $1 per 1,000 requests. Read requests made through Engine API are free, within the RPC limits/plan. 

For transactions through server wallets paid through the user's thirdweb account, users will pay a 5% premium on the gas fee of each transaction completed on any mainnet as part of account abstraction fees. There are no gas charges for testnets.

**Please note: Legacy pricing plans may be subject to the 10% fee specified when signed up instead of 5%. [See pricing page for updated plans and benefits](https://thirdweb.com/pricing)** 

The breakdown for usage and transaction fees can be found in your usage dashboard under the team overview.
