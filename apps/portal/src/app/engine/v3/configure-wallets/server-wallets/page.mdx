# Smart Server Wallets

Smart server wallets are smart accounts designed to perform blockchain operations for backend applications.

## Benefits

Smart server wallets are the recommended way to perform blockchain operations with thirdweb Transactions.

- **Managed Gas Fees**: Smart server wallets manage gas fees for you by automatically paying the fees using the payment method associated with your thirdweb account. You do not have to worry about topping up 
gas funds on your server wallets. 
- **Secure Key Management**: Smart server wallets are secured by Vault. Read more about Vault in the Security section below.
- **Minimal Setup:** Smart server wallets can be created with just a few clicks directly in the thirdweb dashboard. No need to manage private keys or seed phrases or secure with external key management systems.
- **Higher Throughput:** Smart server wallets can handle higher throughput by using multi-dimensional nonces. While thirdweb Transactions handles concurrent transactions through a queue system, smart wallets use parallelization to process multiple transactions at the same time, more efficiently than EOAs.

## Security

Smart server wallets are secured by Vault, thirdweb's secure key management system. This setup ensures that your private keys are never exposed to the server or client, and all transactions are signed securely.
Keys used to manage server wallets including the admin key and access keys can be rotated or re-rolled at any time, should you need to rotate keys for security purposes. Read more about [Vault](/vault).


## Pricing

Smart server wallets cost a gas premium fee for each transaction completed on any mainnet as part of account abstraction fees. There are no gas charges for testnets.
