## About Engine

### Which contracts work with Engine?

Engine supports reads and writes to any contract verified on the blockchain explorer, including any contract deployed via thirdweb.
_Note: Some endpoints allow providing the contract ABI to support any unverified contract._

Engine also supports deploys for thirdweb [prebuilt contracts](https://thirdweb.com/explore) including NFTs, tokens, marketplaces, and smart accounts.

If you have a question about a particular contract type, [contact us](https://thirdweb.com/support).

### How are Engine and the thirdweb Contract SDK different?

Engine is a server that manages your backend wallets and how they interact with contracts. This difference unlocks capabilities that thirdweb and other web3 SDKs, including:

- Management of KMS backend wallets
- Fine-grained access control with access tokens
- Transaction parallelization to handle higher throughput per wallet
- Observability and retries on stuck transactions
- Webhooks on completed transactions to sync onchain and off-chain activity

Additionally, Engine is built on top of the thirdweb SDK and has the same capabilities.

## Using Engine

### How do I wait for a transaction to be mined?

Write calls to contracts do not block until they are mined. Instead they enqueue an async job and immediately return a reference to the job called `queueId`.

Here are three ways to determine when the job is mined:

- Use [webhooks](/engine/features/webhooks) to notify your backend when a transaction event occurs.
- Poll the `/transaction/status/<queue_id>` endpoint.
- Use websockets:

  ```js
  const socket = new WebSocket(
  	"wss://<engine_url>/transaction/status/<queue_id>?token=<session_token>",
  );
  socket.onmessage = (event) => {
  	const res = JSON.parse(event.data);
  	console.log("Received data:", JSON.parse(res.result));
  };
  ```

### How do I send native currency with my transaction?

To send native tokens (e.g. ETH on Ethereum), set `txOverrides.value`.
This may be required when calling a `payable` contract method.

Here's an example of sending 0.2 ETH:

```json
{
  // ...other arguments in the write transaction

  "txOverrides": {
    "value": "200000000000000000"
  }
}
```

### How do I override gas settings?

To override the gas settings, set relevant `txOverrides` gas fields.
Each field is optional and will be estimated by Engine if omitted.

Here's an example of setting a gas limit of 210,000 gas units, 1 gwei max fee, and 1 gwei max priority fee:

```json
{
  // ...other arguments in the write transaction

  "txOverrides": {
    "gas": "210000",
    "maxFeePerGas": "1000000000",
    "maxPriorityFeePerGas": "1000000000"
  }
}
```

<Callout variant='warning' title="It is highly recommended to set a timeout when setting a maxFeePerGas.">

Otherwise if gas prices don't fall, transactions may be in your queue indefinitely.

</Callout>

### How do I set a timeout on transactions?

To specify a transaction timeout, set `txOverrides.timeoutSeconds`.
Engine flags transactions as `errored` if they are not sent before the timeout. An `errored` webhook will be sent.

Note: A transaction sent before the timeout may be mined after the timeout.

Here's an example of a 2-hour timeout:
```json
{
  // ...other arguments in the write transaction

  "txOverrides": {
    "timeoutSeconds": 7200
  }
}
```
