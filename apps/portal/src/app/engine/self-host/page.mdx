Your server is running when this log line appears:

```bash
Listening on https://localhost:3005. Manage your Engine from https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine.
```

#### Manage Engine from the dashboard

To manage your Engine instance from the dashboard:

1. Navigate to `https://localhost:3005/json`

   - The "Your connection is not private" page will appear.
   - Select **Show advanced** and select **Proceed to localhost (unsafe)** to render the JSON file.
   - _This one-time step allows your browser to connect to your local Engine instance._

1. Navigate to the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).
1. Sign in with the `<admin_wallet_address>` wallet.
1. Select **Import**
1. Add your publicly accessible Engine URL.
   - If Engine is running locally, provide the URL `https://localhost:3005`.

### Running Engine in production

See the [Production Checklist](/engine/production-checklist#cloud-hosting) for best practices using Engine in a production environment.

- Pin Engine Docker to a version to control when changes are introduced.
  - `latest` may include major version changes which can introduce breaking changes.
- Host Engine DB on any [Postgres-compatible database](https://www.postgresql.org/support/professional_hosting/).
  - Remember to update `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL`.
  - Examples: [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview)
  - Minimum specs: 2 vCPU, 2 GB memory (AWS equivalent: t4g.small)
  - Minimum version: 14
  - Add the `?connection_limit=10` param to your `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` to increase the connection limit.
- Host Engine server on any cloud provider.
  - Minimum specs: 1 vCPU, 2 GB memory (AWS equivalent: t2.small)
  - Auto-scale the instance count to increase inbound throughput and queuing capacity.
- Remove the `ENABLE_HTTPS` env var.

### FAQ

#### Why is my Docker image unable to reach my Postgres database?

Here are common troubleshooting tips:

- Ensure the Postgres DB is running in Docker. `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` should be set to `localhost` (if in the same container) or `host.docker.internal` (if in a different container).
- Ensure the Postgres DB connection URL and credentials are correct.
- Ensure the database name exists on the Postgres DB.

See [Production Checklist](/engine/production-checklist#cloud-hosting) for best practices using Engine in a production environment.

#### Self-hosting recommendations

- Do _not_ set the environment variable `ENABLE_HTTPS=true`.
- Host Engine Docker on a cloud provider.
  - Minimum specs: 1 vCPU, 2 GB memory (AWS equivalent: t2.small)
  - Auto-scale the instance count to increase inbound throughput and queuing capacity.
- Host Postgres DB on a cloud provider.
  - Examples: [AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/), [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres), [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/postgres), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/overview)
  - Minimum specs: 2 vCPU, 2 GB memory (AWS equivalent: t4g.small)
  - Set the `connection_limit` parameter within your `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` environment variable to `10`.

#### How do I filter logs in Engine?

Configure log verbosity via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
The severity levels ordered from highest to lowest are:

- `fatal` : Terminates the program due to critical errors.
- `error` : Highlights serious issues needing immediate action.
- `warn` : Suggests caution due to potential issues.
- `info` : Shares routine operational insights.
- `debug` : Provides detailed debugging information.
- `trace` : Offers in-depth tracing details.

Engine by default captures logs at `debug` severity and higher. Setting `LOG_LEVEL` to `error` limits logging to only `error` and `fatal` severities.

```bash
LOG_LEVEL="error"
```

#### How to prevent `SIGSEGV` errors with the Engine docker image?

Ensure the Engine docker image's stability by allocating a minimum of `0.5 vCPU & 1 GB memory` to the container, mitigating `SIGSEGV` (Segmentation Fault) errors due to inadequate resources or memory access issues.

#### How to mitigate Prisma errors related connections and/or prisma transactions?

Engine recommends a minimum DB connections limit of `8` PER HOST. Please set the `connection_limit` parameter within your `POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL` environment variable, to allow a connection limit between (8, # conns supported by your DB / # hosts). In practice, 10-20 is a suitable connection limit.

DB Error:

```bash
Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool. More info: http://pris.ly/d/connection-pool (Current connection pool timeout: 10, connection limit: 3)
```

Example configuration:

```bash
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?connection_limit=10
```

#### What is `x-forwarded-for` and how does it affect Engine?

If you have engine running on a server behind a reverse proxy, you can set the `TRUST_PROXY` environment variable to `true` to trust the `X-Forwarded-For` header. Reverse proxies like Nginx or Apache will add this header to the request with the original client IP address, and setting this variable will allow Engine to use the correct IP address for the IP Allowlist. For more details on IP Allowlisting, refer to the [Security Features](/engine/features/security) page.
