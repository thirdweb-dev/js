# NFT Checkout

This guide uses thirdweb Engine to sell NFTs with credit card:

1. A buyer pays with credit card.
1. Upon payment, your backend calls Engine.
1. Engine mints an NFT to the buyer's wallet.

The buyer receives the NFT without requiring wallet signatures or gas funds.

## Prerequisites

- A thirdweb client ID and secret key from the [API Keys page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys)
- An Engine instance
- A [backend wallet](/engine/features/backend-wallets) with currency to pay for gas
- An [access token](/engine/features/authentication) for your Engine instance
- A deployed NFT contract that can be claimed by the backend wallet
- A [Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) on test mode (no real payments will be made)

## Frontend: Add Connect Wallet and credit card form

Use [`<ConnectWallet>`](/react/latest/components/ConnectWallet) to prompt the buyer for their wallet address. The buyer provides their credit card details and selects **Pay now** to send payment details directly to Stripe.

```tsx
function Home() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider activeChain="<chain_id>" clientId="<thirdweb_client_id>">
			<PurchasePage />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

```tsx
// src/app/page.tsx
function PurchasePage() {
	const buyerWalletAddress = useAddress();
	const [clientSecret, setClientSecret] = useState("");

	// Retrieve a Stripe client secret to display the credit card form.
	const onClick = async () => {
		const resp = await fetch("/api/stripe-intent", {
			method: "POST",
			headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
			body: JSON.stringify({ buyerWalletAddress }),
		});
		const json = await resp.json();
		setClientSecret(json.clientSecret);
	};

	const stripe = loadStripe("<stripe_publishable_key>");

	return (
		<main>
			<ConnectWallet />

			{!clientSecret ? (
				<button onClick={onClick}>Buy with credit card</button>
			) : (
				<Elements stripe={stripe} options={{ clientSecret }}>
					<CreditCardForm />
				</Elements>
			)}
		</main>
	);
}
```

```tsx
const CreditCardForm = () => {
	const elements = useElements();
	const stripe = useStripe();

	const onClick = async () => {
		// Submit payment to Stripe. The NFT is minted later in the webhook.
		await stripe.confirmPayment({
			elements,
			confirmParams: { return_url: "http://localhost:3000" },
			redirect: "if_required",
		});
		alert("Payment success. The NFT will be delivered to your wallet shortly.");
	};

	return (
		<>
			<PaymentElement />
			<button onClick={onClick}>Pay now</button>
		</>
	);
};
```

## Backend: Get a Stripe client secret

`POST /api/stripe-intent` returns a client secret which is needed to display the credit card form.

```tsx
// src/app/api/stripe-intent/route.ts

export async function POST(req: Request) {
	const { buyerWalletAddress } = await req.json();

	const stripe = new Stripe("<stripe_secret_key>", {
		apiVersion: "2023-10-16",
	});
	const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
		amount: 100_00,
		currency: "usd",
		payment_method_types: ["card"],
		// buyerWalletAddress is needed in the webhook.
		metadata: { buyerWalletAddress },
	});

	return NextResponse.json({
		clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
	});
}
```

## Backend: Configure the Stripe webhook

`POST /api/stripe-webhook` calls Engine to mint an NFT when a buyer is successfully charged.

```tsx
// src/app/api/stripe-webhook/route.ts

export const config = {
	api: { bodyParser: false },
};

export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
	// Validate the webhook signature
	// Source: https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks#secure-webhook
	const body = await req.text();
	const signature = headers().get("stripe-signature");
	const stripe = new Stripe("<stripe_secret_key>", {
		apiVersion: "2023-10-16",
	});

	// Validate and parse the payload.
	const event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(
		body,
		signature,
		"<webhook_secret_key>",
	);

	if (event.type === "charge.succeeded") {
		const { buyerWalletAddress } = event.data.object.metadata;

		// Mint an NFT to the buyer with Engine.
		const engine = new Engine({
			url: "<engine_url>",
			accessToken: "<engine_access_token>",
		});
		await engine.erc1155.mintTo(
			"<chain_id>",
			"<nft_contract_address>",
			"<backend_wallet_address>",
			{
				receiver: buyerWalletAddress,
				metadataWithSupply: {
					metadata: {
						name: "Engine Hackathon 2023",
						description: "Created with thirdweb Engine",
						image:
							"ipfs://QmakhKF5oMyxupCZ2RsmcvPRyYTHnQzYeb9mQGv3RM81n1/hat.webp",
					},
					supply: "1",
				},
			},
		);
	}

	return NextResponse.json({ message: "OK" });
}
```

## Configure Stripe webhooks

Navigate to the [Stripe webhooks dashboard (test mode)](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks) and add the `/api/stripe-webhook` endpoint and send the `charge.succeeded` event.

## Try it out!

Hereâ€™s what the user flow looks like.

The buyer is prompted to provide their credit card.

<DocImage src={NftCheckout1} alt="Initial page load" className="w-[550px]" />

They provide their card details.

> _Tip: Stripe testmode accepts `4242 4242 4242 4242` as a valid credit card._

<DocImage
	src={NftCheckout2}
	alt="Prompted for card details"
	className="w-[550px]"
/>

They are informed when their payment is submitted.

<DocImage src={NftCheckout3} alt="Successful payment" className="w-[550px]" />
