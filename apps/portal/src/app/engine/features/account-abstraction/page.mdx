# Account Abstraction

Use Engine to deploy, manage, and transact with smart accounts on behalf of your users.

## Deploy an account factory

To deploy smart accounts (referred to as "accounts" from here on), deploy an `AccountFactory` contract. This contract handles deploying individual `Account` contracts for your users.

**Endpoint:** `POST /deploy/<chain>/deployer.thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory`

**Payload:**

```json
{
	"constructorParams": [
		"<default_admin>",
		"0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789"
	] // <default_admin> should be your backend-wallet-address
}
```

## Deploy user accounts

Once the factory is set up, deploy accounts for your users.

**Endpoint:** `POST /contract/<chain>/<account_factory_address>/account-factory/create-account`

**Body:**

```json
{
	"adminAddress": "0x..." // The user's wallet address to deploy a smart wallet for
}
```

This adds the `adminAddress` as the primary admin that can act on behalf of the newly deployed account.

To control the account with a backend wallet, specify the backend wallet in the `adminAddress` field.

## Grant permissions and sessions

Grant & revoke admins on an account with the `/contract/<chain>/<account_address>/account/admins` endpoints.

Grant & revoke sessions on an account which allow specific wallets to interact with specified contracts for a given period of time with the `/contract/<chain>/<account_address>/account/sessions` endpoints.

## Transact with an account

Make write calls with a smart account by calling a write endpoint and specify the `x-backend-wallet-address` and `x-account-address` headers.

The `x-backend-wallet-address` should be set to the engine backend wallet that is an admin over the account.

The `x-account-address` should be set to the deployed account address itself.

Write calls made using these headers will initiate a `UserOperation` sent from the specified account.
