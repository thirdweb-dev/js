# Account Abstraction

<Callout variant="info" title="Looking to use account abstraction for your backend operations?">
Consider using [Smart Backend Wallets](/engine/features/backend-wallets#smart-backend-wallets) instead. They combine EOA and smart account management into a single wallet, with automatic deployment and simplified integration:

- No need to deploy or manage account factories
- No separate account and backend wallet addresses to track
- Works with all existing Engine endpoints without modification
- Built-in transaction batching and recovery
- Automatic gas management with paymaster

Smart backend wallets are recommended when you need account abstraction for your own backend operations. Use the approach described below when you need to manage smart accounts for your users.

</Callout>

Use Engine to deploy, manage, and transact with smart accounts on behalf of your users.

## Deploy an account factory

To deploy smart accounts (referred to as "accounts" from here on), deploy an `AccountFactory` contract. This contract handles deploying individual `Account` contracts for your users.

**Endpoint:** `POST /deploy/<chain>/deployer.thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory`

**Payload:**

```json
{
	"constructorParams": [
		"<default_admin>",
		"0x5FF137D4b0FDCD49DcA30c7CF57E578a026d2789"
	] // <default_admin> should be your backend-wallet-address
}
```

## Deploy user accounts

Once the factory is set up, deploy accounts for your users.

**Endpoint:** `POST /contract/<chain>/<account_factory_address>/account-factory/create-account`

**Body:**

```json
{
	"adminAddress": "0x..." // The user's wallet address to deploy a smart wallet for
}
```

This adds the `adminAddress` as the primary admin that can act on behalf of the newly deployed account.

To control the account with a backend wallet, specify the backend wallet in the `adminAddress` field.

## Grant permissions and sessions

Grant & revoke admins on an account with the `/contract/<chain>/<account_address>/account/admins` endpoints.

Grant & revoke sessions on an account which allow specific wallets to interact with specified contracts for a given period of time with the `/contract/<chain>/<account_address>/account/sessions` endpoints.

## Transact with an account

Make write calls with a smart account by calling a write endpoint and specify the `x-backend-wallet-address` and `x-account-address` headers.

The `x-backend-wallet-address` should be set to the engine backend wallet that is an admin over the account.

The `x-account-address` should be set to the deployed account address itself.

Write calls made using these headers will initiate a `UserOperation` sent from the specified account.
