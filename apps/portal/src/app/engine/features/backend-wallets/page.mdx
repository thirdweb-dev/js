# Server Wallets

Engine performs blockchain actions using backend wallets that you own and manage.

There are multiple options for securing backend wallets.

## Smart Server Wallets

Smart server wallets are the recommended way to perform blockchain operations with Engine. Each smart server wallet consists of an EOA (managed internally by Engine) and a smart account (using thirdweb's default account implementation).

### Benefits

Smart server wallets inherit smart account benefits and offer several advantages over traditional EOAs:

- **Gas Management**: Built-in paymaster eliminates the need to maintain gas tokens. This means you never need to hold crypto or top up gas.
- **Better Nonce Management**: Smart accounts use multi-dimensional nonces, which are more efficient than EOAs.
- **Simple Integration**: Works with all existing Engine endpoints without any code changes.

### How it works

The smart account is automatically deployed the first time you send a transaction on a chain. You don't need to think about deploying or managing the smart account - Engine handles everything behind the scenes. All transactions are sent as UserOperations to the EntryPoint contract on chain.

<Details summary="How are Smart Backend Wallets different from existing engine AA features?">
	Unlike the [previous account abstraction implementation in
	Engine](account-abstraction) where you had to manage both the account address
	(`x-account-address`) and the backend wallet address
	(`x-backend-wallet-address`) separately, smart backend wallets simplify this.
	The backend wallet address is now the smart account address itself.
</Details>

<Details summary="When not to use Smart Backend Wallets?">
	At this time, Smart Backend Wallets do not allow for importing a smart
	account. In use cases where you need to import a smart account (such as with
	session keys), you should use [Engine AA features that utilise the
	`x-account-address` header](account-abstraction).
</Details>

### Configuration Types

- `smart:local` - Smart account backed by a local key
- `smart:aws-kms` - Smart account backed by AWS KMS
- `smart:gcp-kms` - Smart account backed by Google Cloud KMS
- `smart:circle` - Smart account backed by Circle Developer-Controlled Wallets

For AWS and Google Cloud KMS options, follow the setup instructions in the respective sections below.

### Pricing

Smart server wallets have no additional costs to use with your Engine instance. Transactions sent from smart backend wallets follow the [same billing model as regular account abstraction transactions with thirdweb](/connect/account-abstraction/infrastructure#pricing--billing).
Smart accounts need to be deployed on each chain. This costs gas and is billed to your account like any other transaction.

## Local wallet

A local wallet is a wallet created or imported from a private key. Ensure your private key is backed up before transacting with a local wallet in a production environment.

> Local wallets private keys are stored encrypted in Engine's database. For security reasons, private keys cannot be exported.

## AWS KMS wallet

An AWS KMS Wallet is a wallet securely stored in your AWS account. Engine can create and transact with the wallet, but not delete it.

## Circle Wallet

[Circle Programmable Wallets](https://developers.circle.com/w3s/programmable-wallets) is a Wallet as a Service (WaaS) solution designed to simplify the creation and management of secure Web3 wallets and their private keys. Engine can create and transact with the wallet, but not delete it.

#### Setup

1. Create a Circle account at the [Circle Console](https://console.circle.com/signin).
2. Navigate to [API & Client Keys](https://console.circle.com/api-keys).
3. Create an API Key. (Either a standard key or a restricted key scoped to "Programmable Wallets" is required.) Do not enable the IP Allowlist. Store this key, it is not shown again.
4. In the dashboard, navigate to **Configuration > Server Wallets**.
5. Select **Circle** and provide the following:
   - API Key (example: `API_KEY:...`)

<Callout variant="info">
	Circle API Keys are scoped to either Testnet or Mainnet. Server wallets
	created with a testnet key will not work on the mainnet, and vice versa
	<br /> If you want to change between testnet and mainnet, you will need to
	update the API key configuration in engine, and recreate a wallet with the
	Mainnet scope.
</Callout>

## Create a wallet

For AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets, you must provide your credentials.

1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Server Wallets**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. (Optional) Provide a label to organize your wallets.

Circle wallets require creating a [Credential](/engine/features/wallet-credentials) first before creating a wallet.

## Import a wallet

For AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets, you must provide your credentials.

1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Server Wallets**.
1. Select **Import**.
1. Provide the requested fields.
   - See above for instructions for specific wallet types.

## List wallets

In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Server Wallets** to view your wallets created by or imported to Engine.

## Best practices

- It is recommend to use AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets for production use. Private keys are never exposed and the wallet is backed up securely by the cloud provider.
- Use labels and multiple server wallets to organize and track usage.
  - Example: Use one wallet to pay out creators on your platform and another to airdrop NFTs to users.
- If your wallets require topping up gas or ERC20 tokens regularly, consider a separate "funds storage" backend wallet that transfers funds to other wallets via the dashboard UI or API.
