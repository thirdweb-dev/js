# Backend Wallets

Engine performs blockchain actions using backend wallets that you own and manage.

There are multiple options for securing backend wallets.

## Local wallet

A [local wallet](/references/wallets/v2/LocalWallet) is a wallet created or imported from a private key. Ensure your private key is backed up before transacting with a local wallet in a production environment.

> Local wallets private keys are stored encrypted in Engine's database. For security reasons, private keys cannot be exported.

## AWS KMS wallet

An [AWS KMS Wallet](/references/wallets/v2/AwsKmsWallet) is a wallet securely stored in your AWS account. Engine can create and transact with the wallet, but not delete it.

#### Setup

1. [Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) with programmatic access.
1. [Grant the following KMS permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/control-access.html) to this user.
   - `kms:CreateKey`
   - `kms:GetPublicKey`
   - `kms:Sign`
   - `kms:CreateAlias`
   - `kms:Verify`
1. On the user page, navigate to **Security credentials > Access keys**. 
1. Select **Create access key** to get an **Access Key** and **Secret Key**.
1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Configuration > Backend Wallets**.
1. Select **AWS KMS** and provide the following:
   - Access Key (example: `AKIA...`)
   - Secret Key (example: `UW7A...`)
   - Region (example: `us-west-1`)

#### Import an existing wallet

1. Ensure your [KMS key is created](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) with the following settings:
   - Key type: `Asymmetric`
   - Key spec: `ECC_SECG_P256K1`
   - Key usage: `Sign and verify`
1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Backend Wallets**.
1. Select **Import** and provide the following:
   - AWS KMS Key ID (example: `0489da75-9830-4a5a-97e3-e4a6df7775b3`)
   - AWS KMS ARN (example: `arn:aws:kms:us-west-1:632186309261:key/0489da75-9830-4a5a-97e3-e4a6df7775b3`)


## Google Cloud KMS wallet

#### Setup

1. [Enable Google KMS API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-encryption-keys#before-you-begin) for your GCP account.
1. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create).
1. Navigate to the [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) page. Find the service account and select **Edit Principal** to add the following roles:
   - Cloud KMS Admin
   - Cloud KMS CryptoKey Signer/Verifier
1. Navigate to the [Service Accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) page. Select the above service account.
1. Navigate to the **Keys** tab. Select **Add Key > Create new key**.
1. Select **JSON** to download the JSON file. This file contains the key's private key in plaintext.
1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Configuration > Backend Wallets**.
1. Select **Google KMS** and provide the following:

   <Details id="gcpApplicationProjectId" summary="gcpApplicationProjectId">

   This is the Project ID of the GCP project where the key was created.

   **Where to find**:
   - Navigate to the Google Cloud Console.
   - Click on the project dropdown at the top of the page.
   - The Project ID is displayed under your project's name.

   </Details>

   <Details id="gcpKmsLocationId" summary="gcpKmsLocationId">

   This is the location where the keyring was created (e.g., us-central1, europe-west1).

   **Where to find**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to **Security > Cryptographic Keys**.
   - Click on the keyring that contains your key.
   - The location is displayed in the Location field.

   </Details>

   <Details id="gcpKmsKeyRingId" summary="gcpKmsKeyRingId">

   This is the ID of the keyring where your key is stored.

   **Where to find**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to **Security > Cryptographic Keys**.
   - Select the keyring that contains your key.
   - The KeyRing ID is displayed in the list or the URL.

   </Details>

   <Details id="gcpApplicationCredentialEmail" summary="gcpApplicationCredentialEmail">

   This is the email associated with the service account used for accessing the KMS key.

   **Where to find**:
   - In the Google Cloud Console, go to **IAM & Admin > Service Accounts**.
   - Find the service account you are using. its email will be in the format: `name@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`

   </Details>

   <Details id="gcpApplicationCredentialPrivateKey" summary="gcpApplicationCredentialPrivateKey">

   This is the private key of the service account that is used for authenticating API requests.

   **Where to find**:
   - Open the JSON file downloaded above.
   - Copy the value of the `private_key` field.

   </Details>

#### Import an existing wallet

1. Ensure your [keyring is created](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-key-ring) with the following settings:
   - Purpose: `Asymmetric sign`
   - Algorithm: `Elliptic Curve P-256 - SHA256 Digest`
1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Backend Wallets**.
1. Select **Import** and provide the following:
   - GCP KMS Key ID (example: `0489da75-9830-4a5a-97e3-e4a6df7775b3`)
   - GCP KMS Version ID (example: `1`)

## Create a wallet

For AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets, you must provide your credentials.

1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Backend Wallets**.
1. Select **Create**.
1. (Optional) Provide a label to organize your wallets.

## Import a wallet

For AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets, you must provide your credentials.

1. In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Backend Wallets**.
1. Select **Import**.
1. Provide the requested fields.
   - See above for instructions for specific wallet types.

## List wallets

In the dashboard, navigate to **Overview > Backend Wallets** to view your wallets created by or imported to Engine.

## Best practices

- It is recommend to use AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets for production use. Private keys are never exposed and the wallet is backed up securely by the cloud provider.
- Use labels and multiple backend wallets to organize and track usage.
  - Example: Use one wallet to pay out creators on your platform and another to airdrop NFTs to users.
- If your wallets require topping up gas or ERC20 tokens regularly, consider a separate "funds storage" backend wallet that transfers funds to other wallets via the dashboard UI or API.
