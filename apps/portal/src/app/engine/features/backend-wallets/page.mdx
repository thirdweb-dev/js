# Backend Wallets

Engine performs blockchain actions using backend wallets that you own and manage.

There are multiple options for securing backend wallets.

## Local wallet

A [local wallet](/references/wallets/v2/LocalWallet) is a wallet created or imported from a private key. Ensure your private key is backed up before transacting with a local wallet in a production environment.

> Local wallets private keys are stored encrypted in Engine's database. For security reasons, private keys cannot be exported.

## AWS KMS wallet

An [AWS KMS Wallet](/references/wallets/v2/AwsKmsWallet) is a wallet securely stored in your AWS account.

1. [Create an IAM user](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console) with programmatic access.
1. [Grant the following KMS permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/control-access.html) to this user.
   - `kms:CreateKey`
   - `kms:GetPublicKey`
   - `kms:Sign`
   - `kms:CreateAlias`
   - `kms:Verify`

The IAM user credentials are required by Engine to create, import, and transact with AWS KMS wallets.

#### KMS key settings

If creating AWS KMS wallets with Engine, skip this step.

To import an existing KMS key, ensure your [KMS key is created](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html) with the following settings:

- Key type: `Asymmetric`
- Key spec: `ECC_SECG_P256K1`
- Key usage: `Sign and verify`

## Google Cloud KMS wallet

1. [Enable Google KMS API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-encryption-keys#before-you-begin) for your Google project.
1. [Create a Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create).
1. Navigate to **IAM & Admin > IAM**. Find the service account and select **Edit Principal** to add the following roles:
   - Cloud KMS Admin
   - Cloud KMS CryptoKey Signer/Verifier
1. Select the created service account and navigate to the **Keys** tab.
1. Select **Add Key**
1. Select **Create new key**
1. Select **JSON** to download the JSON file. This file authenticates Google Cloud KMS.
1. [Create a keyring](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-key-ring) in Google KMS.
   - Optional: Create a key in the keyring or call `POST /wallet/create`.

## Create a wallet

> For AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets, you must provide your credentials.

Call `POST /backend-wallet/create` or create a wallet from the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).

## Import a wallet

> For AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets, you must provide your credentials.

Call `POST /backend-wallet/import` or import a wallet from the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).

## List wallets

Backend wallets are listed in the **Backend Wallets** table on the [Engine dashboard page](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine).

Or call `GET /backend-wallet/get-all` to list all backend wallets.

## Best practices

- It is recommend to use AWS or Google Cloud KMS wallets for production use. Private keys are not exposed and the wallet is backed up securely by the cloud provider.
- Use labels and multiple backend wallets to organize and track usage.
  - Example: Use one wallet to pay out creators on your platform and another to airdrop NFTs to users.
- If your wallets require topping up gas or ERC20 tokens regularly, consider a separate "funds storage" backend wallet that transfers funds to other wallets via the dashboard UI or API.
