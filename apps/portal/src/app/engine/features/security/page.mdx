# Security

Engine provides you with security features to configure and restrict access to sensitive operations.

## IP Allowlist

You can restrict access to your Engine instance by configuring an IP allowlist. This can be configured in the **Configuration** section of the [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine/).
If an IP allowlist is not configured, Engine will allow all incoming requests.

<Callout variant="info" title="Note">
	This does not affect calls from the Engine dashboard to your Engine instance.
</Callout>

## Domain Allowlist (CORS)

You can restrict access to your Engine instance by configuring a domain allowlist. This can be configured in the **Configuration** section of the [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/engine/).
Multiple domains can be added to the allowlist, and Engine will only accept requests from these domains. A wildcard domain can also be added to allow requests from any domain.
