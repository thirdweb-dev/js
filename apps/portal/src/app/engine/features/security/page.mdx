# Security

Engine provides you with security features to configure and restrict access to sensitive operations.

## IP Allowlist

You can restrict access to your Engine instance by configuring an IP allowlist. This can be configured in the **Configuration** section of the your Engine.
If an IP allowlist is not configured, Engine will allow all incoming requests.

</Callout>

## Domain Allowlist (CORS)

You can restrict access to your Engine instance by configuring a domain allowlist. This can be configured in the **Configuration** section of the Engine settings.
Multiple domains can be added to the allowlist, and Engine will only accept requests from these domains. A wildcard domain can also be added to allow requests from any domain.
