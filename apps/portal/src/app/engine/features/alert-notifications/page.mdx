# Alert Notifications

All cloud-hosted Engine instances (running `v2.0.10` or later) can now configure alert notifications to be notified when an issue is detected on your Engine instance.

## Add an alert

1. Go to [Engine dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine) and select your engine.
1. Navigate to the new *Alerts* tab.
1. Select *Create Alert*.
    - If the button is disabled, see below.
1. Select the type of alert and how to be notified. Currently the following are supported:
    - Alert types: Elevated 5xx rate, stuck nonce
    - Notification types: Webhook, Slack, Email
1. Select *Add Alert*.

	alt="Add alert"
	className="max-w-[500px] mx-auto"
/>

#### Why is my Create Alert button is disabled?

At this time only the original admin (the account which deployed the cloud-hosted Engine) can view and manage alerts. This is usually the first admin address listed on the Admins tab. We plan to expand alert management to all admins in the near future.

## View alert history

You can also view recently fired/resolved alerts on the *Alerts* tab.

	alt="Recent alerts"
	className="max-w-[700px] mx-auto"
