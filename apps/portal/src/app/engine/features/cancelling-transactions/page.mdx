# Cancelling Transactions

Engine submits transactions to the blockchain within 5-10 seconds of receiving a request. During gas or traffic spikes, transactions may take longer to be mined.

In some cases, your application may want to cancel the transaction, such as:

- The transaction was sent in error.
- An NFT collection's supply has run out.
- The transaction's exchange rate has changed and should be re-attempted with a new exchange rate.

When Engine receives a cancellation request:

- If the transaction is completed (mined, errored, or canceled), this endpoint returns an error.
- If the transaction is already submitted to RPC, this endpoint sends a no-op transaction with aggressive gas options to "replace" the original transaction.
- If the transaction is not yet submitted, this endpoint will remove it from the queue.

**When canceled, the transaction will not be re-attempted.** Your backend may safely re-attempt this transaction.

_Note: Use [Retry Transaction](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=https://demo.web3api.thirdweb.com/json#tag/Transaction/operation/retry) instead to increase the gas settings for a queued transaction._

## Cancel a transaction from the API

```typescript
// queueId was returned from a previous write request.

const resp = await fetch("<engine_url>/transaction/cancel", {
	method: "POST",
	headers: {
		"Content-Type": "application/json",
		Authorization: "Bearer <access_token>",
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({ queueId }),
});
if (resp.status === 200) {
	console.log(`Transaction ${queueId} was canceled.`);
}
```
