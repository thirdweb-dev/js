# Preventing Duplicate Transactions

Your backend server may implement retries to handle when an HTTP response from Engine was not received successfully.
In these cases, set an **idempotency key** to drop duplicate submissions of the same transaction.

This approach prevents costly and irreversible errors like transferring funds or minting NFTs more than once.

## Usage

Set the `x-idempotency-key` header to a unique string.

Engine only submits a transaction if there was not another transaction sent with the same idempotency key in the past 24 hours. Subsequent calls with the same idempotency key return the original transaction `queueId`.

## Example

This example safely retries a request up to three times if a 2xx is not received.

```typescript
const idempotencyKey = "27R82mBV"; // Some unique identifier from your app
const numRetries = 3;
let queueId: string | undefined;

for (let i = 0; i < numRetries; i++) {
	const resp = await fetch(url, {
		method: "POST",
		headers: {
			Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.THIRDWEB_ACCESS_TOKEN}`,
			"Content-Type": "application/json",
			"x-backend-wallet-address": "0x4Ff9aa707AE1eAeb40E581DF2cf4e14AffcC553d",
			"x-idempotency-key": idempotencyKey,
		},
		body: JSON.stringify({
			to: "0x4Ff9aa707AE1eAeb40E581DF2cf4e14AffcC553d",
			amount: "42000000000",
		}),
	});

	// If 2xx, break. Else try again.
	if (resp.ok) {
		queueId = (await resp.json()).result;
		break;
	}
}

if (queueId) {
	console.log("Transaction submitted:", queueId);
} else {
	console.error("Unable to submit transaction.");
}
```
