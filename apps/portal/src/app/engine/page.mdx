# Engine

Engine is an open-source, backend server that reads, writes, and deploys contracts at production scale.

## Why use Engine?

Engine enables your app to:

- Send multiple blockchain transactions at once.
- Resubmit stuck transactions, handling nonce values, gas settings, and RPC errors.
- Avoid duplicate transactions.
- Manage multiple backend wallets and their funds.
- Control access from your backends and team members.
- Sponsor user gas fees.
- Deploy and interact with smart accounts.
- Subscribe to contract events and transactions.
