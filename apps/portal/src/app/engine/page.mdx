# Engine

Engine is an open-source, backend server that reads, writes, and deploys contracts at production scale.

## Why use Engine?

Engine enables your app to:

- Send multiple blockchain transactions at once.
- Resubmit stuck transactions, handling nonce values, gas settings, and RPC errors.
- Avoid duplicate transactions.
- Manage multiple backend wallets and their funds.
- Control access from your backends and team members.
- Sponsor user gas fees.
- Deploy and interact with smart accounts.
- Subscribe to contract events and transactions.

🚀 [Get Engine hosted by thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/engine/create) or [self-host for free](/engine/self-host).

### Tiers

Engine is available in two tiers: Cloud and Dedicated. 
- **Cloud**: thirdweb-hosted Engine with autoscaling and high availability.
- **Dedicated**: Self-hosted Engine with full control over your infrastructure.
