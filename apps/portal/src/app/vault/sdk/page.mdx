# Vault SDK

The **@thirdweb-dev/vault-sdk** gives you a type-safe JavaScript/TypeScript client for interacting with a Vault instance from any Node.js or browser environment.

It is built on top of the Vault HTTP API and handles:

- End-to-end encryption to the TEEs (Nitro Enclaves) that protect your keys.
- Type-safe request/response objects (generated from the Rust server types).
- Convenience helpers for signing messages, transactions and typed data.
- Utility helpers for JSON-Web-Token (JWT) based _signed access tokens_.

Use the SDK whenever you need programmatic, non-interactive access to the Vault—CLI tooling, server-side scripts, CI/CD pipelines or browser-based dashboards.

## What you can do

1. **Create and manage service accounts** – bootstrap a new Vault, rotate admin keys.
2. **Create EOAs (wallets)** – generate new non-custodial accounts inside the Vault.
3. **Sign payloads** – transactions, messages, typed-data, EIP-4337 user-ops, …
4. **Mint access tokens** – granular, policy-based bearer tokens for internal or 3rd-party services.
5. **Parse raw transactions** – normalise heterogeneous user input into canonical EVM tx objects.

See the Installation guide for how to add the package and the API Reference for every function available.

## Quick example

```ts
import {
  createVaultClient,
  createEoa,
  signMessage,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/vault-sdk";

// 1. Connect to your Vault instance
const vault = await createVaultClient({
  secretKey: "PROJECT_SECRET_KEY" /* Your thirdweb project secret key */,
});

// 2. Create a new wallet inside the Vault
const { success, data: eoa } = await createEoa({
  client: vault,
  request: {
    auth: { adminKey: process.env.VAULT_ADMIN_KEY! },
    options: {
      metadata: { purpose: "treasury" },
    },
  },
});

if (!success) throw new Error("Failed to create EOA");

// 3. Sign a message with that wallet
await signMessage({
  client: vault,
  request: {
    auth: { adminKey: process.env.VAULT_ADMIN_KEY! },
    options: {
      from: eoa!.address,
      message: "Hello from Vault ✨",
    },
  },
});
```
