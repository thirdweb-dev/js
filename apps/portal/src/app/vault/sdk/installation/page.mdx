# Installation & Setup

The Vault SDK targets modern **ESM** runtimes (Node >= 18 and all evergreen browsers).

## Add the package

```bash
# with pnpm (recommended)
pnpm add @thirdweb-dev/vault-sdk

# or npm
npm install @thirdweb-dev/vault-sdk

# or Yarn
yarn add @thirdweb-dev/vault-sdk
```

## Peer dependencies

The SDK has no required peer-dependencies, but it expects the **`fetch`** Web API to be globally available (Node 18 provides it by default).

If you run on an older Node version, install a fetch polyfill:

```bash
npm install undici --save
```

```ts
// polyfill global fetch (Node < 18)
import { fetch, Headers, Request, Response } from "undici";
// @ts-ignore
globalThis.fetch = fetch;
```

## Initialise a client instance

All requests go through a `VaultClient` that holds your Vault's base URL and the enclave public key:

```ts
import { createVaultClient } from "@thirdweb-dev/vault-sdk";

const vault = await createVaultClient({
  // Get this from your thirdweb dashboard
  secretKey: "PROJECT_SECRET_KEY", 
});
```

`createVaultClient` uses your secret key to establish a connection to the thirdweb vault instance. You can also specify a baseUrl that points to your own vault instance. Cache the resulting `vault` object and reuse it for all subsequent operations.

> **Tip**: If you run multiple Vault instances (dev, staging, prod) create one `VaultClient` per instance.
