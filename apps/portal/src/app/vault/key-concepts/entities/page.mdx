# Entities

Entities are the resources secured by vault. Entities are owned by a vault account.
Vault currently secures the EOA entity.

## EOA

An EOA (Externally Owned Account) is an EVM account controlled by a private key held by a user. It's a fundamental part of the EVM ecosystem, used for managing funds, initiating transactions, and interacting with smart contracts.
The private key to the EOA is always stored encrypted, and only decrypted within vault.

Vault supports the following EOA related operations (API reference):

```typescript
eoa:list
eoa:create
eoa:signMessage
eoa:signTypedData
eoa:signTransaction
eoa:signStructuredMessage
eoa:signAuthorization
```
