# Login

<Callout variant="warning">
	If you are on windows, please avoid using powershell it has some known issues
	that we are actively working on, please use git bash instead or the windows
	command prompt.
</Callout>

Authenticate your device and link it to your thirdweb account with the thirdweb CLI.
By logging in, you can access the thirdweb infrastructure and services which the CLI commands use under the hood such as storage.

```bash
npx thirdweb login [options]
```

## Usage

If it's your first time using the CLI you will need to login with the dashboard in order to use the following commands:

- [Deploy](/contracts/deploy/overview)
- [Publish](/contracts/publish/overview)
- [Upload](/cli/upload)
- [Generate](/cli/generate)

Once you've logged in, your devices will be authorized for future use.

<Callout variant="info">
	If you want to login with an API secret key, e.g. you are using continuous
	integration, you can use the `--key` flag and pass a secret key.
</Callout>

To create a new device to link to your account, use the `--new` flag.

```bash
npx thirdweb login --new
```

## Options

- `-n <string>` or `--new <string>` - Login with a new API secret key

## Login with the dashboard

1. Run the `login` command, this will open the dashboard to allow you to link your device to your thirdweb account.
2. Choose a Device name to identify the device from the devices linked to your account.
3. Click the `Authorize device` button.
4. Sign the message with your wallet (this step is gasless) to authorize the device.

This only needs to be done once per device.

### How it Works

When you login with the dashboard, a number of things happen:

- A [local wallet](/references/wallets/v2/LocalWallet) is created and stored in your device's local storage.
- An auth token is generated for this local wallet.
- The auth token is linked to your wallet when you sign the message.

## Login with an API secret key

If you want to login with an API secret key, e.g. you are using continuous integration (CI), you can use the `--key` flag and pass a secret key.
For example, if you are running the `generate` command with CI:

```bash
npx thirdweb generate --key <secret-key>
```

## Revoking Access

To revoke access to a device:

1. Navigate to the dashboard **Settings page**
2. Click the `Accounts` tab from the sidebar and find the device you would like to revoke.
3. Click the `Revoke Access` button to revoke access to the device.
