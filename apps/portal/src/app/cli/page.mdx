# CLI

The CLI provides tools to create, build, and deploy projects using thirdweb tools and infrastructure. Using the CLI, you can
create new projects with the SDK configured, build, publish and deploy smart contracts, generate types while developing, upload files to IPFS, and more.

## Installation

<Callout variant="warning" title="Usage on Windows">
	If you are on windows, please avoid using powershell it has some known issues
	that we are actively working on, please use git bash instead or the windows
	command prompt.

Install the CLI package globally to use the commands anywhere on your system.

_Note: If you do not wish to install it globally, you can prefix each command with `npx`. i.e. `npx thirdweb <command>`_.

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i -g thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn global add thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm install -g thirdweb"
/>

Once installed, you can view the full list of available commands by running:
