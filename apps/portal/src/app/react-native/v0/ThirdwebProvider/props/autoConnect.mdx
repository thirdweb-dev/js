When the user has connected their wallet to your site, this flag determines
whether or not you want to automatically connect to the last connected wallet when user visits your site again in the future.

Defaults to `true`

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

function MyApp() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider autoConnect={true}>
			<YourApp />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```
