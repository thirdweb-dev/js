Object that contains all text used for thirdweb components.

It allows you to change the language used in UI components or override the texts used in the UI.

You can add support for any language you want just by passing an object with the required strings.

## Example

```javascript
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

<ThirdwebProvider locale="es">
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```
