The `clientId` prop is required to use the thirdweb infrastructure services with the SDK. You can get a client ID by creating an API key [on thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

function MyApp() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider activeChain="ethereum" clientId="your-client-id">
			<YourApp />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```
