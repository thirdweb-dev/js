If you are using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) and have your own `QueryClient`,
you can pass it as the `queryClient` prop to use this client instead of the SDK's default client.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

function MyApp() {
	// Your React Query client (or client from other library such as wagmi)
	const queryClient = new QueryClient();

	return (
		<QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
			<ThirdwebProvider queryClient={queryClient}>
				<YourApp />
			</ThirdwebProvider>
		</QueryClientProvider>
	);
}
```
