# TrustWallet

A wallet configurator for [Trust](/references/wallets/v2/TrustWallet) to integrate the wallet with the React Native SDK

```tsx
import { trustWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const trustConfig = trustWallet(options);
```

<CustomizeWalletConfigurator
	config="trustConfig"
	configurator="trustWallet"
	connectUI="TrustConnectUI"
	selectUI="TrustSelectUI"
/>

## options

<Details summary="projectId" tags={['Recommended']}>

This `projectId` can be obtained at [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/). It is highly recommended to use your own project id and only use the default one for testing purposes.

```ts
trustWallet({
	projectId: "your-wallet-connect-project-id",
});
```

</Details>

<Details summary="recommended" tags={['Optional']} >

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the [ConnectWallet Modal](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#connect-wallet).

```ts
trustWallet({
	recommended: true,
});
```

</Details>

## Usage with ConnectWallet

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#connect-wallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider supportedWallets={[trustWallet()]} clientId="your-client-id">
	<YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with useConnect

you can use the [`useConnect`](/references/react-native/v0/useConnect) hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#connect-wallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

```tsx
const trustConfig = trustWallet();

function App() {
	const connect = useConnect();

	const handleConnect = async () => {
		await connect(trustConfig, connectOptions);
	};

	return <View> ... </View>;
}
```

### connectOptions

```ts
{ chainId?: number } | undefined
```

<Details summary="chainId" flags={['Optional']}>

If `chainId` is provided, wallet will be connected and immediately switch to network with given `chainId`.

`Chain` object corresponding to this chainId from [@thirdweb-dev/chains](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/chains) package must be specified in ThirdwebProvider's supportedChains prop as shown below

```tsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

export function YourApp() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]} clientId="your-client-id">
			<App />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```
