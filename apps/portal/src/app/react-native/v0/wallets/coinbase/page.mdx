# Coinbase Wallet

A wallet configurator for [Coinbase Wallet](/references/wallets/v2/CoinbaseWallet) which allows integrating the wallet with React Native

```tsx
import { coinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const coinbaseConfig = coinbaseWallet(options);
```

<CustomizeWalletConfigurator
	config="coinbaseConfig"
	configurator="coinbaseWallet"
	connectUI="CoinbaseConnectUI"
	selectUI="CoinbaseSelectUI"
/>

## options

<Details summary='callbackURL' id='callbackURL'>

The Coinbase Wallet Mobile SDK uses Universal Links to communicate between Coinbase Wallet and your application.
We wrote [a short guide](/react-native/v0/faq#how-to-enable-deep-links-in-your-apps) to help you enable deep links support in your mobile app or
you can check the [Coinbase setup](https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/wallet-sdk/docs/ios-setup).

```ts
coinbaseWallet({
	callbackURL: new URL("your.scheme://"),
});
```

</Details>

<Details summary="recommended" id='recommended' flags={['Optional']}>

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#connect-wallet) modal.

```ts
coinbaseWallet({
	recommended: true,
});
```

</Details>

## Usage with ConnectWallet

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#connect-wallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
	supportedWallets={[coinbaseWallet()]}
	clientId="your-client-id"
>
	<YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with useConnect

you can use the [`useConnect`](/references/react-native/v0/useConnect) hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#connect-wallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

```tsx
const coinbaseConfig = coinbaseWallet();

function App() {
	const connect = useConnect();

	const handleConnect = async () => {
		await connect(coinbaseConfig, connectOptions);
	};

	return <div> ... </div>;
}
```
