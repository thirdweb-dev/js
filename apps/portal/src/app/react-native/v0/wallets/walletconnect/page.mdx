# WalletConnect

A wallet configurator for [Wallet Connect](/references/wallets/v2/WalletConnect) which allows integrating the wallet with React Native

```tsx
import { walletConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const walletConnectConfig = walletConnect(options);
```

<CustomizeWalletConfigurator
	config="walletConnectConfig"
	configurator="walletConnect"
	connectUI="WalletConnectConnectUI"
	selectUI="WalletConnectSelectUI"
/>

## options

<Details summary="projectId" tags={["Recommended"]}>

Your project's unique identifier that can be obtained at [cloud.walletconnect.com](https://cloud.walletconnect.com). It is highly recommended to use your own project id and only use the default one for testing purposes.

It Enables following functionalities within Web3Modal:

- wallet and chain logos,
- optional WalletConnect RPC,
- support for all wallets from our Explorer and WalletConnect v2 support.

Defaults to thirdweb's common project id.

```javascript
import { WalletConnect } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";

const wallet = new WalletConnect({
	projectId: "<PROJECT_ID>",
});
```

</Details>

<Details id="recommended" summary="recommended">

Show this wallet as "recommended" in the [ConnectWallet Modal](/react-native/v0/components/ConnectWallet).

```ts
walletConnect({
	recommended: true,
});
```

</Details>

## Usage with ConnectWallet

To allow users to connect to this wallet using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/components/ConnectWallet) component, you can add it to [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) prop.

```tsx
<ThirdwebProvider
	supportedWallets={[walletConnect()]}
	clientId="your-client-id"
>
	<YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

## Usage with useConnect

You can use the [`useConnect`](/references/react-native/v0/useConnect) hook to programmatically connect to the wallet without using the [ConnectWallet](/react-native/v0/components/ConnectWallet) component.

The wallet also needs to be added in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) if you want the wallet to auto-connect on next page load.

```tsx
const walletConnectConfig = walletConnect();

function App() {
	const connect = useConnect();

	const handleConnect = async () => {
		await connect(walletConnectConfig, connectOptions);
	};

	return <div> ... </div>;
}
```

### connectOptions

```ts
{ chainId?: number } | undefined
```

<Details id="chainId" summary="chainId">

If `chainId` is provided, wallet will be connected and immediately switch to network with given `chainId`.

`Chain` object corresponding to this chainId from [@thirdweb-dev/chains](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/chains) package must be specified in [ThirdwebProvider's supportedWallets](/react-native/v0/connecting-wallets#supported-wallets) prop as shown below

```tsx
import { Polygon } from "@thirdweb-dev/chains";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

export function YourApp() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider supportedChains={[Polygon]} clientId="your-client-id">
			<App />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

</Details>
