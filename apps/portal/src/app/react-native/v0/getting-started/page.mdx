# Getting Started

Our SDK uses a [Provider Pattern](https://flexiple.com/react/provider-pattern-with-react-context-api/), meaning any component within the `ThirdwebProvider` will have access to the SDK.

<Callout variant='info' title="API Key">

You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services with the SDK.

you need to first obtain an API key from the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team) by creating a new project and then copy the "Client ID" and pass it to the `ThirdwebPovider` as the `clientId` prop.

</Callout>

Let's take a look at a typical setup.

## Configure the ThirdwebProvider

Specify the network your smart contracts are deployed to in the `activeChain` prop and wrap your application like so:

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const App = () => {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider activeChain={"mainnet"} clientId={"your-client-id"}>
			<AppInner />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
};
```

Below is an example of where to set this up in your application:

<p>
	[Create React Native
	App](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/react-native-typescript-starter/blob/main/App.tsx)
</p>

Finally, we can run our app!

```sh
yarn android
```

```sh
yarn ios
```

## Connect to a wallet using ConnectWallet component

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView } from "react-native";
import { ConnectWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

const AppInner = () => {
	return (
		<SafeAreaView style={styles.backgroundStyle}>
			<ConnectWallet />
		</SafeAreaView>
	);
};
```

## Interact With Contracts

Connect to your smart contract using the [`useContract`](/references/react-native/v0/useContract) hook like so:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import { useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

export default function Home() {
	const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");

	// Now you can use the contract in the rest of the component!
}
```

You can then use [`useContractRead`](/references/react-native/v0/useContractRead) and [`useContractWrite`](/references/react-native/v0/useContractWrite) to read data and write transactions to the contract.

You pass the `contract` object returned from [`useContract`](/references/react-native/v0/useContract) to these hooks as the first parameter and the name of the function (or view/mapping, etc.) on your smart contract as the second parameter. If your function requires parameters, you can pass them as additional arguments.

For example, we can read the `name` of our contract like so:

```jsx title="pages/index.jsx"
import {
	useContract,
	useContractRead,
	useContractWrite,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

export default function Home() {
	const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
	const { data: name, isLoading: loadingName } = useContractRead(
		contract,
		"name", // The name of the view/mapping/variable on your contract
	);
	const { mutate: setName, isLoading: settingName } = useContractWrite(
		contract,
		"setName", // The name of the function on your contract
	);
}
```

## Using Extensions

Each extension you implement in your smart contract unlocks new functionality in the SDK.

These hooks make it easy to interact with your smart contracts by implementing the complex logic for you under the hood.

For example, if your smart contract implements [ERC721Supply](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-721/ERC721Supply), you unlock the ability to view all NFTs on that contract using the SDK; which fetches all of your NFT metadata and the current owner of each NFT in parallel. In the React SDK, that is available using `useNFTs`:

```jsx
import { useContract, useNFTs } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

export default function Home() {
	const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
	const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);
}
```

If we want to mint an NFT and our contract implements [ERC721Mintable](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-721/ERC721Mintable), we can use the [`useMintNFT`](/references/react-native/v0/useMintNFT) hook to mint an NFT from the connected wallet; handling all of the logic of uploading and pinning the metadata to IPFS for us behind the scenes.

```jsx
import { useContract, useNFTs, useMintNFT } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

export default function Home() {
	const { contract } = useContract("<CONTRACT_ADDRESS>");
	const { data: nfts, isLoading: isReadingNfts } = useNFTs(contract);
	const { mutate: mintNFT, isLoading: isMintingNFT } = useMintNFT(contract);
}
```

## Advanced Configuration

The `ThirdwebProvider` offers a number of configuration options to control the behavior of the React Native and Typescript SDK.
We provide defaults for all of them, but you customize them to suit your needs. For more info see the [ThirdwebProvider reference](/references/react-native/v0/ThirdwebProvider).

### Supported Wallets Behavior

1. We render `localWallet` as "Continue as Guest" in our ConnectWallet modal.
2. When a single `supportedWallet` is defined, we try to auto-connect to that wallet instead of showing the wallets modal with a single wallet.

### Localizing our UI components

You can pass a `locale` prop to the `ThirdwebProvider` with the strings in the language of your preference. See the list of strings to translate [here](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/blob/main/packages/react-native/src/evm/i18n/en.ts).

We support 'en' (English), 'es' (Spanish) and 'ja' (Japanese) out of the box. The default value is 'en'.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider locale={"ja"}>
			<AppInner />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
};
```

You can pass your own strings:

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, en } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider
			locale={{
				connect_wallet: {
					label: "Conectar Cartera",
				},
				connect_wallet_details: {
					additional_actions: "Acciones Adicionales",
					// ...
				},
			}}
		>
			<AppInner />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
};
```

Note that you can also use this prop to replace any string in our UI components.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, en } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider locale={en({
       ... // you can overwrite any string!
    })}>
      <AppInner />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
};
```
