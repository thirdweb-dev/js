A signer is an abstraction of an Ethereum Account,
which can be used to sign messages and initiate transactions.

Since the `ThirdwebSDKProvider` is used when you want to provide your own wallet connection logic,
you will need to provide a `signer` prop to inform the SDK of the wallet you want to use to sign transactions.

Libraries such as [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.5.2/), [wagmi](https://wagmi.sh), etc.
all provide ways to get a signer.

To use this signer with the SDK, pass it to the `signer` prop. If the signer is connected, the SDK will use this wallet
to sign transactions for all write operations on the blockchain.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebSDKProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";
import { ethers } from "ethers";

function MyApp() {
	// Example: Use ethers to get the signer from the window.ethereum object
	const signer = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum).getSigner();

	return (
		<ThirdwebSDKProvider
			activeChain={"ethereum"}
			signer={signer}
			clientId="your-client-id"
		>
			<App />
		</ThirdwebSDKProvider>
	);
}
```
