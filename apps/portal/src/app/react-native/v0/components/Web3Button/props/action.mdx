The logic to execute when the button is clicked.

The contract instance is available as the first argument of the function
for you to interact with.

If the action you are performing is async, make sure to return a `Promise` from the `action` function so that the SDK knows when the action is complete

```jsx
import { Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-native";

// For example, claim an NFT from this contract when the button is clicked
function App() {
	return (
		<Web3Button
			contractAddress="0x..."
			action={async (contract) => {
				await contract.erc721.claim(1);
			}}
		>
			Claim NFT
		</Web3Button>
	);
}
```
