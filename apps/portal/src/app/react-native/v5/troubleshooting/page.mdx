# Troubleshooting

## Expo Go

Due to required native dependencies, you cannot use Expo Go for running your app. You must use a development build.

You can create ios/android development builds using the following command:

```shell
npx expo prebuild
```

You can then run the development build using the following command:

```shell
npx expo run:ios
```

```shell
npx expo run:android
```

## OpenSSL iOS build error

If you see a build error that mentions OpenSSL, you may need to update `app.json` to pin a version of OpenSSL that is compatible with your Xcode version.

Here's how to pin the OpenSSL version in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "ios": {
          "extraPods": [
            {
              "name": "OpenSSL-Universal",
              "configurations": ["Release", "Debug"],
              "modular_headers": true,
              "version": "<OPENSSL_VERSION>"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `<OPENSSL_VERSION>` with the correct version of OpenSSL for your Xcode version:

- Xcode 16: `3.3.2000`
- Xcode 15: `3.1.5004`

Make sure you have `expo-build-properties` added to your `package.json` dependencies.

## Android minSdkVersion error

If you see an Android error mentioning `minSdkVersion`, you may need to update your `app.json` to set the `minSdkVersion` to a higher version.

Here's how to update the `minSdkVersion` in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "plugins": [
      "expo-build-properties",
      {
        "android": {
            "minSdkVersion": 26
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Make sure you have `expo-build-properties` added to your `package.json` dependencies.
