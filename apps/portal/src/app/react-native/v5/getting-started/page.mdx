# Getting Started

### Automatic Installation

We recommend starting a new thirdweb React Native project using our CLI, which sets up everything automatically for you.

In your CLI, run:

```bash
npx thirdweb create --legacy-peer-deps --react-native
```

or clone the [expo-starter](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/expo-starter) repo using git.

<GithubTemplateCard

	descrption="A starter template for using the thirdweb package in a React Native app"
	href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/expo-starter"
/>

### Manual Installation

To manually install the React Native SDK, you'll need to install the `@thirdweb/react-native-adapter` package from npm on top of the `thirdweb` package.

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the packages">

Using your favorite package manager or expo, install all the require dependencies

```shell
npx expo install thirdweb @thirdweb-dev/react-native-adapter
```

Since react native requires installing native dependencies directly, you also have to install these required peer dependencies:

```shell
npx expo install react-native-get-random-values @react-native-community/netinfo expo-application @react-native-async-storage/async-storage expo-web-browser expo-linking react-native-aes-gcm-crypto react-native-quick-crypto amazon-cognito-identity-js @coinbase/wallet-mobile-sdk react-native-mmkv react-native-svg @react-native-clipboard/clipboard
```

Here's an explanation of each peer dependency and why its needed:

```ts
// needed for wallet connect
react-native-get-random-values
@react-native-community/netinfo
expo-application

// needed wallet connect + in-app wallet
@react-native-async-storage/async-storage

// needed for inapp wallet
expo-web-browser // for oauth flows
amazon-cognito-identity-js // for authentication
react-native-aes-gcm-crypto // for encryption
react-native-quick-crypto@0.7.0-rc.6 // for fast hashing

// needed for coinbase wallet
@coinbase/wallet-mobile-sdk
react-native-mmkv

// needed for UI components
react-native-svg 
@react-native-clipboard/clipboard
```

</Step>
<Step title="Edit your `metro.config.js`">

If you don't already have a `metro.config.file.js` in your project, you can create one by running:

```shell
npx expo customize metro.config.js
```

Then, you need to add 2 properties to the metro resolver: `unstable_enablePackageExports` and `unstable_conditionNames`. This is to tell metro to resolve named `exports` properly.

```js
// file: metro.config.js

// Learn more https://docs.expo.io/guides/customizing-metro
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("expo/metro-config");

/** @type {import('expo/metro-config').MetroConfig} */
const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);

// ADD THESE 2 PROPERTIES
config.resolver.unstable_enablePackageExports = true;
config.resolver.unstable_conditionNames = [
	"react-native",
	"browser",
	"require",
];

module.exports = config;
```

</Step>
<Step title="Import `@thirdweb-dev/react-native-adapter`">

### Without `expo-router`

Simply import the package in the entrypoint of your app before any other import. This will polyfill all the required functionality needed.

```js
// file: App.tsx

// this needs to be imported before anything else
import "@thirdweb-dev/react-native-adapter";
// ... the rest of your app
```

### With `expo-router`

If you're using `expo-router`, you need to polyfill before the router entry:

#### 1. create a `index.js`

Create an `index.js` file at the root of the repo. This will be the new entrypoint to your app, ensuring the polyfills happen before any routing.

```ts
// file: index.js

// this needs to be imported before expo-router
import "@thirdweb-dev/react-native-adapter";
import "expo-router/entry";
```

#### 2. Change your main entrypoint in `package.json`

Now you can replace `expo-router/entry` with `./index.js` as your main entrypoint.

```ts
// file: package.json

"main": "./index.js",
```

<Callout variant="info" title="Additional notes">

1. `react-native-aes-gcm-crypto` requires `minSDK 26` for android, you can edit this in your `app.json` file.
2. You will get some warnings about unresolved exports, this is normal and will get better as the libraries get updated.

</Callout>

</Step>

<Step title="Run the development build">

You can run the development build using the Expo CLI, note that this needs to use the 'development build' option and not Expo Go.

<Callout variant="info" title="Expo Go">

Due to conflicts between Expo Go's wrapper and thirdweb's, **Expo Go is not currently supported**. When running your app, be sure to run a normal development build without using Expo Go.

If the Expo CLI says "Using Expo Go" when starting the app, press `s` to switch to the development build.

</Callout>

Examples:

```shell
npx expo:run ios
```

</Step>

<Step title=" Use the `thirdweb` package normally">

Once all the setup above is all done, you can use the most of functionality in the `thirdweb` package out of the box, without having to do any react native specific code.

This means that you can follow all the React documentation and expect it all to be exactly the same.

Examples:

```tsx
// import thirdweb hooks, extensions, provider and wallets as usual
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";
import { balanceOf, claimTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";
```

</Step>
</Steps>
