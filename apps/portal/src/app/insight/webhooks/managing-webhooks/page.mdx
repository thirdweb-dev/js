# Managing Webhooks

For most up to date technical spec refer to https://insight-api.thirdweb.com/reference#tag/webhooks.

## List Webhooks
`GET /v1/webhooks`

Retrieve all webhooks for your project or get details for a specific webhook by ID.

## Create Webhook
`POST /v1/webhooks`

Creates a new webhook subscription.  
It may take up to a minute to start working.

### Verifying the created webhook
- The webhook starts in a suspended state
- An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to your webhook URL for verification
- You must verify the webhook within 15 minutes using the OTP
- Once verified, it may take up to a minute for the webhook to become fully active
- You can request a new OTP if you can't retrieve the initial OTP

## Update Webhook
`PATCH /v1/webhooks/:webhook_id`

You can modify the URL or filters of a webhook. Additionally you can enable and disable the webhook.  
Changes may take up to a minute to take effect.

### Updating webhook URL
- If you update the webhook URL, you'll need to verify it again with a new OTP
- Other fields can be updated without requiring re-verification

## Delete Webhook
`DELETE /v1/webhooks/:webhook_id`

Permanently removes a webhook subscription. This action cannot be undone.

## Verify Webhook
`POST /v1/webhooks/:webhook_id/verify`

Activates a webhook using the OTP code that was sent to your webhook URL. Required for:
- New webhook creation
- After updating a webhook URL

## Resend OTP
`POST /v1/webhooks/:webhook_id/resend-otp`

Request a new OTP code if the original expires or is lost:
- Invalidates the previous OTP
- New OTP expires after 15 minutes
- Only works for webhooks pending verification

## Test Webhook
`POST /v1/webhooks/test`

Sends a sample payload signed with a test secret ('test123').  
Useful for testing your receiver endpoint before creating actual webhooks.
