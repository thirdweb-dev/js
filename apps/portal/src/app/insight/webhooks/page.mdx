# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive notifications when specific blockchain events or transactions occur. This enables you to automate workflows and keep your applications in sync with on-chain activity.

## About Webhooks

### Data Delivery
Webhook events are collected and delivered in batches for optimal performance and reliability. This makes webhooks ideal for:
- Tracking when specific blockchain events occur
- Aggregating on-chain data
- Building analytics and monitoring systems
- Triggering downstream processes

### Delivery Guarantees
Events are guaranteed to be delivered *at least once*.  
Your application should implement idempotency and deduplication logic using the unique event ID in the payload.  
Events may occasionally be delivered out of order.

### Performance Requirements
- Your receiving endpoint must respond within 3 seconds
- If your endpoint consistently fails to respond in time, the webhook will be automatically suspended
- We recommend implementing a queue system if you need to perform time-consuming operations
