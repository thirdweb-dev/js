# Insight Use Cases

Insight offers versatile use cases for using blockchain data within applications, enabling developers to track and analyze a wide array of on-chain activities. 
With Insight, you can efficiently monitor transfer events, transactions, token ownership, NFT collections, and staking activities across multiple chains, and more,
making it a powerful tool for building dynamic blockchain applications.

| Use Case | Blueprint(s) |
| --- | --- |
| Display in-game assets such as items or tokens (ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155) tied to the player's wallet. | Use Events Blueprint to fetch transfer events where the player’s wallet is the recipient, showing all NFTs or in-game items acquired by the player. |
| Display earned tokens based on achievements or progress rewarded to players in games. | Use Transactions Blueprint to track transactions where the game’s smart contract sends tokens to a player’s wallet. <br/> Use Events Blueprint to filter transfer events from the game’s contract to list all tokens awarded to players. |
| Analyze token economics such as daily trading volume to understand token liquidity or market activity. | Use the Transactions Blueprint to get transactions involving any token and then aggregate data based on timestamps to calculate 24-hour transaction volumes. |
| Analyze gas consumption of different transactions to help minimize gas fees for users by evaluating high-gas transactions or commonly used functions. | Use Transactions Blueprint to summarize gas usage across transactions for specific functions, helping to analyze and optimize protocol functions for efficiency. |
| Analyze token ownership to understand community health and investment risks. | Use Events Blueprint to track token transfer events, allowing users to analyze the distribution and concentration of token holders. |
| Track the movements of an entire NFT collection. | Use Events Blueprint to capture all transfer events for a specified collection and show ownership history or current trading volume for the collection. |
| Fetch all NFTs owned by a specific wallet address. | Use Events Blueprint to fetch transfer events for each NFT contract where the specified wallet address is the recipient. |
| Fetch all transactions emitted by a single wallet across multiple chains. | Use Transactions Blueprint to filter transactions by wallet address across different chain_ids to provide a historical view of cross-chain transactions. |
| Fetch all tokens owned by a specific wallet address. | Use Events Blueprint to find transfer events where the wallet address is the recipient, providing a list of token balances. |
| Detect wallet staking activity on platforms such as AAVE or other DeFi protocols. | Use Events Blueprint to filter for staking-related events such as deposits, and monitor which wallets are actively staking. |
