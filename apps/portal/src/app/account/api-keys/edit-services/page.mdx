<DocImage src={ProjectOverview} alt="Project Overview" />

</Step>

<Step title="Project Settings">

Navigate to the project's settings and locate "Enabled Services".

<DocImage src={EnabledServices} alt="Enabled Services" />

</Step>

<Step title="Modify Services">
Toggle the specified service you want on or off. Each service is on by default and toggling will turn off access to the service for the project.
</Step>

</Steps>
