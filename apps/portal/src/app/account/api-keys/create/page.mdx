<Step title="Setup Domain Restriction">
Input the domains you want to restrict your application to in Allowed Domains then select Next. **Restricting domains is highly recommended for any applications with client-side code or frontend applications.**

1. Authorize all domains by selecting the checkbox or inputting `*` into the text field
2. Authorize local URLs with `localhost:<port>`


</Step>

<Step title="Store Secret key">

Store your secret key in a secure location and confirm that you have stored it by checking the checkbox then select Complete.

<Callout variant="warning">
	Do not share secret keys. They grant access to all thirdweb services. Secret
	keys should only be used in backend environments like CLI, scripts, and
	servers. Never expose secret keys in client-side code due to the lack of
	access restrictions.
