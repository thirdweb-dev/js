# Access Restrictions

API Keys provide two forms of access restrictions:

- Domain IDs: A domain ID is used to restrict access to the enabled thirdweb infrastructure services based on a specific domain. It serves as an identifier for websites.
- Bundle IDs: A bundle ID is a unique identifier used to restrict the Client ID to your Unity native or mobile application.
