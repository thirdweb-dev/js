# Manage Teams

Use teams to organize your different applications. Teams have separate assets, team members, usage analytics, billing, and limits.

Your account can be a member of multiple teams, and teams may have one or more members.

<Callout variant="info" title="Creating teams is free">
    There is **no cost** to create a team. Billing accounts, including subscriptions, invoices, and features, are completely independent for each team.
