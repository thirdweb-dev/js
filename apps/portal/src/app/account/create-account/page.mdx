Start by navigating to the [thirdweb login portal](https://thirdweb.com/login).

- Email, Social, Passkey or Mobile (In-App) Wallet
- Externally Owned Account Wallet (ex. MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom Wallet, etc.)
- Multi-signature Wallet (ex. Safe)

<Callout variant="info" title="Default Email">
	For in-app wallet users, the default email used when signing in acts as the
	account's associated email address. For EOAs, you will be prompted to enter an email address.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step title="Setup Team">

Upon signing up, you will be prompted to create your team by entering a team name and avatar. These will be used to identify your team in the dashboard and appear on shared projects.
