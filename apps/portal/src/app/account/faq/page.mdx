<Details summary="How do I get my bundle Id for a Unity Native or mobile application?"> 
If you are developing a Unity native or mobile application, you will need to obtain a `bundleId` to restrict the Client ID to your application.

- **Unity Native**, use either of the following options:
  - Log `Utils.GetBundleId()`.
  - Check the platform-specific options in your Project Settings. It is usually formatted as `com.companyName.productName` based on your top-level Project Settings.
- **Mobile (React Native)**

  - **Android**
    - Open the file `<Project>/android/app/build.gradle` and search for the term `applicationId`:
      ```jsx
      android {
          defaultConfig {
          applicationId "com.example.yourproject"
          ...
          }
        }
      ```
  - **iOS**
    - Open the file `<Project>/ios/<Project>/Info.plist` and search for `CFBundleIdentifier`:
      ```jsx
      <key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
      <string>com.example.yourproject</string>
      ```
  - Programmatically retrieve `bundleId` for iOS or Android

    - Use the `expo-application` package from the `@thirdweb-dev/react-native sdk`

      ```jsx
      import * as Application from "expo-application";

      const bundleId = Application.applicationId;
      ```
