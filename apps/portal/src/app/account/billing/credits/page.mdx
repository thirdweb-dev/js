# Credits

Credits let you cover the costs of using thirdweb services. There are currently two types of credits available on thirdweb:

- **Optimism Superchain Credits**
Optimism superchain credits are redeemed from a program which aims to enable developers to create seamless web3 user onboarding experiences powered by Smart Accounts. [Learn more about the OP Superchain program.](https://thirdweb.com/superchain)

- **Service Credits**: These credits can be applied across any thirdweb service on any chain. This includes usage across In-App Wallets, RPC, and IPFS storage. To get thirdweb credits, apply to join the [startup program.](https://thirdweb.com/community/startup-program).
