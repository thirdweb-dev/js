# Account Info

## Sign-in with wallet

Users are able to sign-in and connect to thirdweb using any of the following wallet options:

- Email (In-App) Wallet
- Externally Owned Account Wallet (ex. MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom Wallet, etc.)
- Multi-signature Wallet (ex. Safe)

Upon signing-in, users will be prompted to create a new thirdweb account by providing their email address and (optionally) billing information.

<Callout variant="warning" title="In-App Wallet Default Email">
	For in-app wallet users, the default email used when signing in acts as the
	account's associated email address.
</Callout>

## Linking multiple wallets to an existing thirdweb account

To link another wallet to the same email and billing profile:

1. Disconnect your current logged-in wallet from the dashboard.
2. Login with the new wallet you want to link to an existing profile.
3. Upon login, specify your status with “I have an existing account”
4. Enter the email address of the existing account you want to link to.
5. Fill in the one-time password (OTP) or 6-letter code sent to your email

Your wallet is now linked to an existing thirdweb account with associated billing info.
