# RPC Edge

Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Edge provides reliable access to querying data and interacting with the blockchain through global edge RPCs.

<DocImage src={rpcDiagramImage} alt="RPC Diagram" />

By default, we provide publicly available RPCs for over 900+ EVM Networks. [View the default RPC endpoints](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/infrastructure/rpc-edge) for each supported chain.

<Callout variant="info" title="Accessing your RPC URL">
	To use RPC Edge with other tools like Anvil, take a chain's [public RPC endpoint](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist) and attach your app's client ID from your [account settings](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/settings/api-keys) `https://<chainId>.rpc.thirdweb.com/<clientId>`.
</Callout>

#### Features

- **Reduced Latency:** Global edge caching reduces latency by utilizing geographically distributed servers, smart routing, and caching RPC responses. RPC endpoints run on the edge with over 150+ worldwide locations, resulting in minimized latency, especially for frequently requested responses.
- **Improved Performance:** Create critical and scalable applications with maintained uptime and low latency, thanks to reduced response times.
- **High Reliability:** Utilize fallback across multiple providers to ensure high reliability.
- **Cost Efficient:** More cost-efficient at scale compared to competitors.
- **Compatible with any EVM Blockchain:** Use RPC Edge with any deployed contract on any EVM blockchain.

#### Pricing & Billing

RPC pricing is based on requests per second. If you're interested in upgrading your RPC Edge limits, you can find more information on the different tiers by visiting [thirdweb's pricing page](https://thirdweb.com/pricing).
