## Logo

import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<ConnectButton

				}}
			/>
		</div>
	);

You can set the theme for the [ConnectButton](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButtonProps#theme) component, which is set to `"dark"` by default. theme can be set to either `"dark"` , `"light"` or a custom theme object.

We have **`[lightTheme](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/lightTheme)`** or **`[darkTheme](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/darkTheme)`** providers that you can override to kickstart customization.

You can refer to our `Theme` page for a full view of customizable options if you’d prefer to create a custom theme from scratch.

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

function Example() {
	return (
		<div>
			<ConnectButton theme={yourThemeConfig} />
		</div>
	);
}
```
