# Wallets FAQ

## General

<Details summary="Which blockchains are supported for wallets?">
	View all the supported chains for wallets on [thirdweb chainlist](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist?service=connect-sdk).
</Details>

<Details summary="How do I troubleshoot unexpected console error messages?">
	Make sure that you are developing on a [secure origin](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features/), which includes <code>localhost</code> and any site on <code>https://</code>. thirdweb uses cryptography libraries that are unsupported on <code>http://</code>.

	If you continue to run into a console error, please [contact us](https://thirdweb.com/support) with more details.
</Details>

<Details summary="Do you support gasless transactions?">
	Yes, you can easily use account abstraction with in-app wallets to enable sponsored (gasless) transactions. Learn more in our [sponsor gas guide](/transactions/sponsor).
</Details>

<Details summary="Does thirdweb Wallets product use smart contract wallets?">
	Thirdweb wallets can be used as a signer to a smart contract account (account abstraction), but it can also be used as a standalone EOA.
</Details>

## User Wallets

<Details summary="What login options does thirdweb support?">
	For a full list of supported authenticated options, we recommending searching the [playground](https://playground.thirdweb.com/wallets/sign-in/button). Wallets also supports custom authentication if you want to integrate thirdweb into your own auth system.
</Details>

<Details summary="How will my users recover their accounts in case they lose access to their auth?">
	Currently, users will rely on the built-in recovery of their auth method. Refer to the [How to recover your Google Account or Gmail](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7682439?hl=en) article as an example for social and email auths.

	Users can also link their account to a different auth method (e.g. email, phone, or social). All linked methods will be able to be used to access their accounts, providing an alternate recovery method in the case where one is lost.
</Details>

<Details summary="Do I need to build separate flows for user wallets and external wallets (e.g. MetaMask)?">
	No, since our SDK provides the wallet <code>signer</code>, you can build a unified experience with the same code to handle how all your users' wallets interact with signatures and smart contracts.

	However, you will need to provide a separate flow to create in-app wallets as you would with any wallet provider (WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.).
</Details>

## Server Wallets

## Ecosystem Wallets

<Details summary="Can I edit my Ecosystem Wallet name and icon after it is created?">
Yes, you can change your Ecosystem Wallet name and icon. However, you cannot change the Ecosystem Wallet slug.
</Details>

## Security & Recoverability

<Details summary="How is the private key managed?">
	Learn more about the architecture of how thirdweb wallets are created and stored [in the security docs.](/wallets/security).
</Details>

<Details summary="What happens if thirdweb or my database gets breached?">
	Using enclave, your customers' assets are safe even if thirdweb or you are compromised. This is because the attacker will only be able to access the encrypted keys, and that is not enough to reconstruct the private key.
</Details>

<Details summary="How do I export my private key?">
	Learn how to export the private key for a thirdweb wallet using the Connect modal.

	<Callout variant="info" title="Programmatic Exports">
		It's not possible to export a user's private key programmatically. Our system is designed to be non-custodial and only users can access their full keys.
	</Callout>

	<Steps>
		<Step title="Login">
			Login to your wallet on the application.
		</Step>

		<Step title="Manage">

			<DocImage src={ManageWallet} />
		</Step>

		<Step title="Export">
			Choose "Export Private Key" and confirm the action to reveal the private key.
			<DocImage src={ExportKey} />
		</Step>

		<Step title="Confirm">

			<Callout variant="warning" title="Secure Private Keys">
				Revealing private keys can compromise your assets and security. Keep them safe and confidential at all times.
			</Callout>
			<DocImage src={ConfirmReveal} />
		</Step>

		<Step title="Reveal">
			Copy the exported private key directly from the modal.
			<DocImage src={ExportedKey} />
		</Step>
	</Steps>

	<Callout variant="info" title="Advanced Configuration">
		As an advanced option, to hide the export private key option from the modal, set the `hidePrivateKeyOption` to `true` when initializing the typescript or react SDK.
	</Callout>
</Details>

<Details summary="What happens if thirdweb ceases to exist? Will my users be able to access their wallets?">
	In the event that thirdweb ceases to exist, we have committed to keeping our user service running for a period of at least 12 months after the shutdown announcement. During this time users will be able to access their wallet and transfer their assets out, or export their private key which they can then import into a different client.
</Details>
