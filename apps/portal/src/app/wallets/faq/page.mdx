# General FAQs

### Which blockchains are supported?

Our thirdweb In-App Wallet is fully EVM compatible and supports all EVM chains.

### Do I need to build separate flows for in-app wallets and external wallets (e.g. MetaMask)?

No! Since our SDK provides the wallet `signer`, you can build a unified experience with the same code to handle how all your users' wallets interact with signatures and smart contracts.

However, you will need to provide a separate flow to create in-app wallets as you would with any wallet provider (WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet, etc.).

### How do I troubleshoot unexpected console error messages?

Make sure that you are developing on a [secure origin](https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/prefer-secure-origins-for-powerful-new-features/), which includes `localhost` and any site on `https://`. thirdweb uses cryptography libraries that are unsupported on `http://`.

If you continue to run into a console error, please contact us with more details.

### What login options does thirdweb support?

We support a lot of authentication options out of the box. For a full list, check out the [playground](https://playground.thirdweb.com/connect/sign-in/button). We also support custom authentication if you want to integrate thirdweb into your own auth system.

### Do you support gasless transactions?

Yes, you can easily use account abstraction with in-app wallets to enable sponsored (gasless) transactions.

### Does thirdweb Wallets product use smart contract wallets?

Thirdweb wallets can be used as a signer to a smart contract account (account abstraction), but it can also be used as a standalone EOA.

### What happens if thirdweb ceases to exist? Will my users be able to access their wallets?

In the event that thirdweb ceases to exist, we have committed to keeping our in-app wallet service running for a period of at least 12 months after the shutdown announcement. During this time users will be able to access their wallet and transfer their assets out, or export their private key which they can then import into a different client.

### How will my users recover their accounts in case they lose access to their auth?

Currently, users will rely on the built-in recovery of their auth method. Refer to the [How to recover your Google Account or Gmail](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7682439?hl=en) article as an example for social and email auths.

Users can also link their account to a different auth method (e.g. email, phone, or social). All linked methods will be able to be used to access their accounts, providing an alternate recovery method in the case where one is lost.


# Security FAQs

### How is the private key managed?

You can learn more about the architecture of how thirdweb wallets are created and stored [here](/wallets/security).

### What happens if thirdweb or my database gets breached?

Using enclave, your customers' assets are safe even if thirdweb or you are compromised. This is because the attacker will only be able to access the encrypted keys, and that is not enough to reconstruct the private key.
