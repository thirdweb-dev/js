# Dedicated Relayer

**Dedicated Relayers** provide fully managed, private transaction infrastructure designed to give your application the dedicated resources it needs to scale.

Unlike shared relayers where your transactions are processed alongside thousands of other applications, a Dedicated Relayer ensures guaranteed throughput, lower latency, and isolation from traffic spikes.

## Why use a Dedicated Relayer?

## Setting up a Dedicated Relayer

1. Navigate to the [thirdweb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
2. Select your project and go to **Wallets > Dedicated Relayer** in the sidebar.
3. Choose a plan that fits your needs:
    - **Standard**: For startups and apps with moderate volume.
    - **Premium**: For enterprise-grade scale with higher throughput limits.
4. Configure your fleet by selecting the chains you want to support.

Once deployed, your application's gasless transactions will automatically be routed through your dedicated infrastructure.
