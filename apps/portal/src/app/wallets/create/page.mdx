# User Wallets

thirdweb supports creating wallets with various authentication methods: social logins, email, SMS, passkeys, and more. For every user, thirdweb generates a [non-custodial wallet](/connect/wallet/security) behind the scenes.

<AuthMethodsTabs/>

## Bring your own auth system

If you already have an auth system, you can use thirdweb to attach wallets to your existing users:

<Stack>
    <ArticleIconCard
        href="/connect/in-app-wallet/custom-auth/configuration"
        icon={EcosystemWalletsIcon}
        title="Custom Authentication"
        description="Learn more about custom authentication with your own auth system"
    />
</Stack>
