# Pregenerate Wallets

Create wallets for users before they authenticate, enabling smoother onboarding and pre-funded asset distribution.

## Use Cases

- **Pre-assign wallets** to users before signup
- **Reduce onboarding time** by eliminating wallet creation delays  
- **Pre-fund wallets** with tokens or NFTs before users claim them
- **Create smooth experiences** for gaming and app onboarding
- **Distribute assets** like game items, welcome bonuses, or promotional NFTs

## API Reference

<OpenApiEndpoint path="/v1/wallets/user" method="POST" />

<Callout variant='info' title='Ecosystem Requirements'>
For ecosystem wallets, the secret key must be from the same account as the ecosystem owner.
</Callout>

<Callout variant='warning' title='Smart Wallet Addresses'>
The API returns the EOA (admin wallet) address. Use [`predictSmartAccountAddress`](/references/typescript/v5/predictSmartAccountAddress) to get the corresponding smart contract wallet address.
</Callout>

## Next Steps

Pregeneration doesn't change the user experience. Users can login normally and will automatically receive their pregenerated wallet.

For more information, see the [User Wallets](/wallets/users) documentation.
