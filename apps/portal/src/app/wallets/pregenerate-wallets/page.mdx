# Pregenerate Wallets

### What is Wallet Pregeneration?

Wallet pregeneration is a technique where you create wallets for users before they actually sign up or authenticate. This allows you to:

1. Pre assign wallets to users before they sign up
2. Reduce the time users spend waiting during the onboarding process
3. Pre-fund wallets with tokens or NFTs before users claim them
4. Create smoother user experiences for gaming and other applications

### Why Use Wallet Pregeneration?

You can distribute assets to wallets before users claim them, enabling:
- Pre-loaded game assets
- Welcome bonus tokens
- Promotional NFTs
- Airdrops

## Endpoint

To pregenerate an in-app or ecosystem wallet wallet, you can make a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

```http
POST https://api.thirdweb.com/v1/wallets/user/pregenerate
Content-Type: application/json
x-secret-key: <your-secret-key>
x-ecosystem-id: <your-ecosystem-id> (optional)
x-ecosystem-partner-id: <your-ecosystem-partner-id> (optional)

{
  "type": "email",
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

## Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following parameters:

- `type`: The type of wallet identifier to pregenerate a wallet for: 
  - Email based: `email`, `google`, `facebook`, `discord`
  - Phone based: `phone`
  - Wallet based: `signer`
  - User ID based: `custom_jwt` or `custom_auth_endpoint`
- `email` or `phone` or `userId` or `walletAddress`: The user identifier associated with the wallet to be generated

### Email based wallets

```
{ type: "email", email: "user@example.com" }
```

When the user logs in with any method associated with that email (including google, facebook, discord auth), they will get access to the same pregenerated wallet.

### Phone based wallets

```
{ type: "phone", phone: "+1321123321" }
```

### Custom user id based wallets

```
{ type: "custom_auth_endpoint", userId: "some_user_id" }
```

{/* TODO: update link when custom auth documentation has been updated */}
Use this when [bringing your own authentication method](/wallets/custom-auth). When the user logs in, if the user ids you provide from the auth endpoint match, they will get access to the same pregenerated wallet.

## Headers

You need to include the following headers:

- `Content-Type`: Must be set to `application/json`
- `x-secret-key`: Your secret key for authentication
- `x-ecosystem-id` (optional): Your ecosystem ID
- `x-ecosystem-partner-id` (optional): Your ecosystem partner ID

## Example Request

Here's an example curl command to pregenerate a thirdweb wallet for the user `user@example.com`:

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.thirdweb.com/v1/wallets/user/pregenerate' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-id: ecosystem.example-eco-123' \
  -H 'x-ecosystem-partner-id: 1415d24e-c7b0-4fce-846e-740841ef2c32' \
  -H 'x-secret-key: <your-project-secret-key>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "type": "email",
    "email": "user@example.com"
  }'
```

Replace the header values with your actual client ID, ecosystem ID, and secret key.

<Callout variant='info' title='Pregeneration for ecosystems'>
For ecosystem wallets, the secret key have to be from the same account as the ecosystem owner. If this is an issue, please reach out to us.
</Callout>


## Response Format

A successful API call returns a JSON object in the following format:

```json
{
  "result": {
      "address": "string",
      "createdAt": "string",
      "profile": "object[]"
  }
}
```

<Callout variant='warning' title='EIP-4337 Smart Wallet Address'>
Use [`predictSmartAccountAddress`](/references/typescript/v5/predictSmartAccountAddress) to generate the corresponding smart contract wallet address.
The `address` field always corresponds to the EOA address (admin wallet) that has been pregenerated.
</Callout>


## What's Next

Pre-generating is independent and doesn't change the user's experience. 

Your users can continue to login as per usual. When they do, they will be assigned the pregenerated wallet.

For more information on signing in, see the [User Wallets](/wallets/users) section.
