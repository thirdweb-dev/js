# Quickstart

Learn how to add Connect SDK to your application, log in your users, and allow them to interact with your application.

The following guide is in Typescript. You can also learn how to integrate Connect with our [Unity SDK](https://portal.thirdweb.com/unity).

<Steps>
<Step title="Install the Connect SDK">

```bash
npm i thirdweb
```

</Step>

<Step title="Get Your Client ID">

Log in to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team). Create a new project to get your **Client ID**.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up the Client, Provider and ConnectButton">

1. Pass your clientId to `createThirdwebClient`
2. Wrap your application with a `ThirdwebProvider`
3. Add a `ConnectButton` to your application

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

export const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: <your_client_id> });

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton client={client} />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Interact With A Wallet">

Once your user has logged in by clicking the `ConnectButton`, you can interact with their wallet.

Here's how to:
1. Get the wallet address using `useActiveAccount`
2. Read the wallet balance using `useWalletBalance`

```tsx
import { useActiveAccount, useWalletBalance } from "thirdweb/react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  // 1. get wallet address
  const account = useActiveAccount();
  console.log("wallet address", account?.address);

  // 2. get wallet balance
  const { data: balance, isLoading } = useWalletBalance({
    client,
    chain,
    address: account?.address,
  });
  console.log("wallet balance", balance?.displayValue, balance?.symbol);
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Send a Transaction">

[Extensions](/typescript/v5/extensions/use) are the easiest way to prepare transactions.

1. Import the Extension you want to use
2. Define your contract with `getContract` on your target chains
3. Call the `useSendTransaction` mutation hook
4. Execute the transaction using the mutate function

```tsx
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
import { useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";
// 1. import the extension you want to use
import { transfer } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";

// 2. define the target contract
const USDC = getContract({ client, address: USDC_ADDRESS, chain: sepolia });

export default function MyComponent() {
  // 3. call the useSendTransaction hook
  const { mutate: sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();

  const onClick = () => {
    // 4. execute the transaction (send 15 USDC to the target address)
    const transaction = transfer({ contract: USDC, amount: 15, to: "0x..." });
    sendTransaction(transaction);
  }
}
```

</Step>



<Step title="You're Ready to build">

Congratulations, you've connected a wallet and sent a transaction from your application! You can now explore all the other accessible features in [the full React documentation.](/react/v5)
