A Smart account is a smart contract wallet that follows the [ERC-4337 specification](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337).

Ethereum has 2 types of accounts to transfer and receive tokens: EOAs (Externally Owned Accounts) and Contract Accounts. A smart account is a wallet managed by a contract account
instead of an EOA. A smart account is a wallet type requiring **no private keys or seed phrases**.
Smart accounts rely on code instead of private keys to secure and recover wallet information.

**A smart account is a type of Web3 wallet powered by smart contracts.**

This smart account is unlocked by a 'key' - a personal account. This key can be anything from a [MetaMask wallet](/connect/external-wallets/io.metamask) or even an [In-App Wallet](/connect/in-app-wallet/overview) and is used as a way to 'sign in' to the wallet.

## Benefits of Smart Accounts

1. Optimized transaction efficiency & batch transactions
   - Combine multiple transactions into a single atomic transaction
2. Improved Security Features
3. Social & Multi-Sig Recovery
   - Recover a wallet without seed phrases/passwords
   - Nominate a trusted person to recover your wallet in the case of an emergency
4. Programmability
   - Smart accounts can be programmed to do anything a smart contract can do
   - Smart accounts can be upgraded to add new features

## Account Factories

In order to issue smart accounts for users, an account factory contract must be used.
This factory contract is responsible for deploying individual user contracts when required.
The SDK provides a global factory ready to use, but you can also deploy your own factory.

## Terminology

### Personal Wallet/Key

This is the default admin on an account or the "key" to an account. It can be any wallet and is used to initialize the account.
Only one wallet can only be the "key" to one account per factory contract.

This wallet is the primary way to access and interact with the account.

### Account

The account is the ERC-4337 compatible smart contract which holds all of the assets.

### UserOperations

This is the data structure for the "pseudo-transaction" that the user wants to perform. The transaction is pseudo as Smart Accounts cannot initiate transactions on EVM chains as they are not supported natively. It contains the following fields:

- `sender`: The account making the operation.
- `nonce`: Anti-replay parameter; also used as the salt for first-time account creation.
- `initCode`: The initialization code needed to create the account (needed if and only if the account is not yet onchain).
- `callData`: The data to pass to the `sender` during the operation.
- `callGasLimit`: The amount of gas to allocate for the operation.
- `verificationGasLimit`: The amount of gas to allocate for the verification step.
- `preVerificationGas`: The amount of gas to pay to compensate the bundler for pre-verification execution and calldata.
- `maxFeePerGas`: Maximum fee per gas (similar to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559) `max_fee_per_gas`).
- `maxPriorityFeePerGas`: Maximum priority fee per gas (similar to [EIP-1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559)).
- `paymasterAndData`: Address of the paymaster sponsoring the transaction, followed by extra data to send to the paymaster (empty for self-sponsored transaction).
- `signature`: Data passed into the account along with the nonce during the verification step. Should depend on the `chainid` and `EntryPoint` address to prevent replay attacks.

### EntryPoint

The EntryPoint is a singleton contract (a contract that has a predictable address that is the same on every chain).
It has two methods that are used as entry points to execute bundles of UserOperations: `handleOps` and `handleAggregatedOps`.

### Bundler (relayer)

A bundler is a node that monitors the alternative mempool of `UserOperations` and bundles multiple `UserOps` together to forward to the EntryPoint contract as a single transaction.
These `UserOps` can be sent from different accounts and are bundled and sent to the `EntryPoint` contract via a `handleOps` call.

The bundler is controlled by its own EOA which initially pays for the gas fees upfront and is then repaid by either the sender or a paymaster if the transaction is sponsored.

The entry point contract then uses the `validateOp` and `executeOp` functions on the smart account contract to verify and execute the `UserOps` on behalf of the users.

It allows you to send transactions with smart accounts.

### Paymaster

A paymaster is a smart contract that relays transactions. It provides a service that enables a third party to pay
the transaction fee on behalf of the user by funding the Paymaster contract in advance. The paymaster acts as a gas reserve which then
can be used during the call execution via the `EntryPoint` contract. The thirdweb [Account abstraction](/connect/account-abstraction) paymaster is initially paid for by thirdweb. By using an API key,
the usage is tracked and billed. You can easily define [sponsorship rules](/connect/account-abstraction/sponsorship-rules) that determine whether a transaction will be sponsored.
