# Using Account Abstraction in React

By using the [TypeScript SDK](/typescript/v5), you can use smart accounts in your front-end applications easily.

<Steps>

<Step title="Create an API key">

To use the bundler and paymaster, you must create an API key and a billing account.

To create an API Key:

- Head to the settings page in the dashboard and click the **API Keys** tab.
- Click on **Create API Key**.
- Follow the steps to create your API key.

To use account abstraction infrastructure on mainnet you will also need to [create an account and add a payment method](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/settings/billing).

</Step>

<Step title="Create an App">

To use smart accounts in a React app you can either:

- Start from a template like our [Next.js](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-starter) or [Vite](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/vite-starter) starter.
- Add the dependencies to an existing project using `npm i thirdweb` or your favorite package manager.

In this guide, we'll use the [Next.js starter template](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/next-starter).

Clone the repo and follow the instructions in the README to set up the project.

</Step>
<Step title="Build your connection UI">

#### Using Connect Wallet (prebuilt UI)

To use the [Connect Button](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButton) component to connect your users to your app using smart accounts, we just need to pass the `accountAbstraction` prop.

You can change the configuration based on your requirements.

```tsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId: "your-client-id" });

function App() {
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<ConnectButton
				client={client}
				accountAbstraction={{
					chain: sepolia,
					sponsorGas: true,
				}}
			/>
		</div>
	);
}
```

Clicking on the connect button will show the following Modal which allows you to connect a personal wallet. This is the personal wallet you are using to initialize the smart account.

After connecting your personal wallet, a smart account is created for you and connected to the application.

#### Using the `useConnect` hook (custom UI)

The [useConnect](/references/typescript/v5/useConnect) hook allows you to programmatically connect your application to the wallet. You will need to build your own UI for connecting the wallet.

```tsx
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

function Example() {
	// 1. set the `accountAbstraction` configuration
	const { connect } = useConnect({
		client,
		accountAbstraction: {
			chain: sepolia,
			sponsorGas: true,
		},
	});

	const connectToSmartAccount = async () => {
		// 2. connect with the admin wallet of the smart account
		connect(async () => {
			const wallet = inAppWallet(); // or any other wallet
			await wallet.connect({
				client,
				chain: sepolia,
				strategy: "google",
			});
			return wallet;
		});
	};

	return <button onClick={() => connectToSmartAccount()}>Connect</button>;
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Use the Smart account">

Now that you have connected your smart account to your app, you can use it to send transactions and interact with smart contracts.

Deploy a NFT Drop contract from the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/nft-drop) or build your own [ERC 721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) compatible contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/overview).

Use the dashboard to upload some NFTs that we will claim with our smart account.

To claim an NFT, we will use the [TransactionButton](/references/typescript/v5/TransactionButton) component to send the transaction.

```tsx
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useActiveAccount, TransactionButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { claimTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const contract = getContract({ client, chain, address: "0x..." });

// The ThirdwebProvider setup above already handles the connection to the smart account
// Within the provider, you can use the SDK normally to interact with the blockchain
export default function MyComponent() {
	// Get the connected smart account
	const smartAccount = useActiveAccount();
	// Fetch owned NFTs
	const { data, isLoading } = useReadContract(
		getOwnedNFTs,
		{
			contract,
			address: smartAccount.address!,
		},
		{
			enabled: !!smartAccount,
		},
	);
	// Mint a new NFT
	return (
		<TransactionButton
			transaction={() => {
				if (!account) return;
				return claimTo({
					contract,
					to: account.address,
					quantity: 1,
				});
			}}
			onTransactionConfirmed={() => {
				alert("NFT Minted!");
			}}
		>
			Mint NFT
		</TransactionButton>
	);
}
```

</Step>

<Step title="Conclusion">

In this guide, we learned how to connect users to a React app using two methods:

- With the Connect Wallet component.
- With a custom UI component via the `useConnect` hook.
