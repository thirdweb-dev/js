# Account Factories

By default, the SDK uses a global account factory deployed on most chains:

- [`AccountFactory`](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory) at address [`0x85e23b94e7F5E9cC1fF78BCe78cfb15B81f0DF00`](https://thirdweb.com/1/0x85e23b94e7F5E9cC1fF78BCe78cfb15B81f0DF00) for Entrypoint v0.6.
- [`AccountFactory_0_7`](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/AccountFactory_0_7) at address [`0x4be0ddfebca9a5a4a617dee4dece99e7c862dceb`](https://thirdweb.com/1/0x4be0ddfebca9a5a4a617dee4dece99e7c862dceb) for Entrypoint v0.7.

The default account factory deploys standard, immutable accounts with the features listed below. However, you can customize the behavior of your apps smart accounts by deploying your own account factory contracts.

## Deploy your own Account Factory contract

You can deploy your own Account Factory via the [explore page](https://thirdweb.com/explore/smart-wallet) or build your own [ERC 4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) compatible factory contract using the [Solidity SDK](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337).

thirdweb offers different kinds of prebuilt account factories:
