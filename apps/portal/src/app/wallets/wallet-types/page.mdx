# Understand Different Wallet Types

## User Wallets

User wallets (also called _Embedded Wallets_) are automatically generated for users when they sign in through supported authentication methods like email, social login, or custom auth.

They’re stored securely in a trusted environment (such as a secure enclave or MPC) and give users a seamless, traditional onboarding experience without needing to handle seed phrases.

**Best for:**

- Apps that want a frictionless login + wallet experience
- Users new to crypto
- Applications managing authentication and wallet creation together

## Server Wallets

**Server wallets** (also known as **developer wallets** or **backend wallets**) are controlled by the backend and used for performing programmatic actions such as minting tokens, settling payments, or automating on-chain operations.

**Best for:**

- Server-side scripts and backend operations
- API payment facilitation and settlement flows
- Secure automation of transactions

## External Wallets (EOAs)

External wallets are self-custodial wallets owned and managed directly by users. Examples include MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Phantom, and more.

**Best for:**

- Web3-native users comfortable managing their keys
- Dapps requiring wallet signatures or on-chain transactions
- Direct blockchain interaction via the browser

## Ecosystem Wallet

Ecosystem Wallets are embedded wallets that support brand-customization and provide a single identity across multiple applications or games.

**Best for:**

- Platforms or ecosystems that include multiple apps, games, or partner integrations
- Managing access controls, permissions, and partner integrations programmatically
