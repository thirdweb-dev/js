# Native Account Abstraction (via EIP-7702 Smart EOAs)

With the recent Ethereum upgrade Pectra, EIP-7702 allows you to upgrade your EOA and get SmartWallet-like functionality with:
- Much cheaper gas costs, batching functionality
- No account separation - your wallet address does not change, not even on zksync chains (once they implement EIP-7702)
- Much faster execution, with the option of paying for gas yourself or having thirdweb manage gas sponsorship, similar to SmartWallet.

The API is also drastically simplified!

### ExecutionMode.EIP7702Sponsored
Upgrade to an EIP7702 smart account, unlocking all functionality of 4337 without the downsides, and thirdweb handles the execution and gas sponsorship for you!
```csharp
var smartEoa = await InAppWallet.Create(
    client: thirdwebClient,
    authProvider: AuthProvider.Google,
    executionMode: ExecutionMode.EIP7702Sponsored
);
```

### ExecutionMode.EIP7702
Upgrade to an EIP7702 smart account, unlocking all functionality of 4337 without the downsides, but sponsoring gas yourself.
```csharp
var smartEoa = await InAppWallet.Create(
    client: thirdwebClient,
    authProvider: AuthProvider.Google,
    executionMode: ExecutionMode.EIP7702
);
```

### ExecutionMode.EOA
"Normal" EOA Execution, no smart account functionality
```csharp
var basicEoa = await InAppWallet.Create(
    client: thirdwebClient,
    authProvider: AuthProvider.Google,
    // does not need to be explicitly passed, is the default but we're showing it here
    executionMode: ExecutionMode.EOA
);
```

_When using EIP-7702 execution modes - if not already delegated to a smart account - an EIP-7702 authorization will be signed and bundled with your first transaction, similar to how 4337 works with initcode, but without the large gas costs, slower execution and chain specific requirements._

# SmartWallet (via EIP-4337 Bundlers)

Instantiate a `SmartWallet` to enable advanced blockchain interactions, including gasless transactions through account abstraction. This wallet type is especially useful for creating a user-friendly experience in decentralized applications.

## Usage

```csharp
var smartWallet = await SmartWallet.Create(personalWallet, chainId);
```

<Callout variant="info" title="Advanced Functionality">
	This method sets up a SmartWallet with optional gasless transactions,
	leveraging account abstraction. It's designed for developers looking to create
	seamless blockchain interactions within their applications.
</Callout>

<Details summary="Parameters">

### personalWallet (required)

An instance of IThirdwebWallet (e.g., `PrivateKeyWallet` or `InAppWallet`). Represents the personal wallet connected to the SmartWallet.

### chainId (required)

The blockchain network's chain ID as a `BigInteger`. Identifies the network the smart wallet interacts with.

### factoryAddress (optional)

The address of the factory contract used to deploy new smart wallet instances.

### gasless (optional)

A `boolean` indicating if the wallet should operate in a gasless mode for transactions.

### accountAddressOverride (optional)

Overrides the default account address for the smart wallet. Useful for session key advanced use cases.

### entryPoint (optional)

The entry point contract address for account abstraction.

### bundlerUrl (optional)

URL of the bundler server used for processing User Operations.

### paymasterUrl (optional)

URL of the paymaster service that sponsors gas for User Operations.

### tokenPaymaster (optional)

The `TokenPaymaster` (enum) representing the ERC20 token you want users to pay gas fees with.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### SmartWallet

Returns an instance of `SmartWallet`, configured with the provided parameters and ready for blockchain interactions.

Example

Here's how you can create a SmartWallet for a user, assuming you already have a ThirdwebClient and a personal wallet (PrivateKeyWallet or InAppWallet) set up:

```csharp
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create(clientId: "yourClientId", bundleId: "yourBundleId");
var personalWallet = await PrivateKeyWallet.Create(client, "yourPrivateKeyHex");

BigInteger chainId = 137; // Polygon mainnet
bool gasless = true; // Enable gasless transactions

var smartWallet = await SmartWallet.Create(
    personalWallet,
    gasless,
);

Console.WriteLine($"SmartWallet address: {await smartWallet.GetAddress()}");

// Sign a message (this will also deploy your smart wallet if it hasn't been deployed yet)
var message = "Hello, Thirdweb!";
var signature = await wallet.PersonalSign(message);
Console.WriteLine($"Signature: {signature}");
```
