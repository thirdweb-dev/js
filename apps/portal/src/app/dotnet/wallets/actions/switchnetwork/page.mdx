# IThirdwebWallet.SwitchNetwork

This method allows setting the active chain of the wallet if applicable.

When using Smart Wallets, make sure any overrides to default contracts, such as factories, are deployed on all chains you intend to switch to. We also support switching between zksync and non-zksync chains.

## Usage

await wallet.SwitchNetwork(chainId);
```
