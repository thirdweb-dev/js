# IThirdwebWallet.Disconnect

This method cleanly disconnects the wallet instance from the blockchain network or any related services, effectively ending the session.

**Note:** When using `InAppWallet` this will clear the session and require the user to re-authenticate to reconnect later on. When using `SmartWallet` this will disconnect the personal wallet it uses as a signer.

## Usage

```csharp
await wallet.Disconnect();
```

<Details summary="Description">

The `Disconnect` method is used to terminate any active connection or session that the wallet might have with the blockchain network or related services. This can include disconnecting from a web3 provider, clearing any cached authentication, or other necessary cleanup actions to ensure a clean state.
