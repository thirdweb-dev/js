# [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702) Integration (Low-level API)
Integrates `authorizationList` for any transactions.
This EIP essentially allows you to set code to an EOA, unlocking a world of possibilities to enhance their functionality.
An authority may execute its own authorization, the only difference is internal whereby the authorization nonce is incremented by 1.

You almost never need to use this API directly, but it's available for low-level access. Use higher level [Account Abstraction](/dotnet/wallets/providers/account-abstraction) APIs instead.

## Usage

```csharp
var authorization = await eoaWallet.SignAuthorization(chainId: chainWith7702Support, contractAddress: delegationContractAddress, willSelfExecute: false);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### chainId (required)

Your chain ID as a `BigInteger` value.

### contractAddress (required)
The address of the contract you want to authorize. Your EOA will essentially become a smart contract if this authorization is executed.

### willSelfExecute (required)
Whether the authorization will be executed by the EOA itself or by a third-party. It will affect the nonce of the authorization.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### string

The method returns an `EIP7702Authorization` object that can be passed to our `ThirdwebTransaction`/`ThirdwebTransactionInput` related APIs and broadcast as such.
