// Grant a session key to pk wallet (advanced use case)
var receipt = await smartWallet.CreateSessionKey(
    signerAddress: await privateKeyWallet.GetAddress(),
    approvedTargets: new List<string>() { Constants.ADDRESS_ZERO },
    nativeTokenLimitPerTransactionInWei: "0",
    permissionStartTimestamp: "0",
    permissionEndTimestamp: (Utils.GetUnixTimeStampNow() + 86400).ToString(),
    reqValidityStartTimestamp: "0",
    reqValidityEndTimestamp: Utils.GetUnixTimeStampIn10Years().ToString()
);
```
