# EcosystemWallet.GenerateExternalLoginLink

This method returns a URL that can be used to forward the logged-in session of In-App or Ecosystem Wallets from .NET to React apps built using thirdweb.

Configure your React website to use thirdweb Connect, open the link generated by this method and your users will be autoconnected.
If using Ecosystem Wallets, make sure to create the ecosystem wallet with the same ecosystem id and partner id (if any) and include it as one of your wallets in, for example, your ConnectButton's wallets prop.
Make sure you're using the same api key on both ends.

var url = await ecosystemWallet.GenerateExternalLoginLink();
