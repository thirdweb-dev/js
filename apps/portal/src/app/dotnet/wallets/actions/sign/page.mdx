# IThirdwebWallet.PersonalSign

This method allows signing a string message using the wallet's private key. The signed message proves the message's integrity and authenticity, demonstrating that the message was indeed created by the owner of the private key.

**Note:** When using `SmartWallet`, calling this method from an undeployed smart account will make use of [EIP-6492](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6492).

## Usage

```csharp
string signature = await wallet.PersonalSign("Your message here");
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### message (required)

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### string
