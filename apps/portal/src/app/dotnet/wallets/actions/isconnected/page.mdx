# IThirdwebWallet.IsConnected

Determines whether the wallet instance is currently connected to the blockchain network and any related services.

**Note:** an `InAppWallet` returning `false` here means that it could not auto-connect to the wallet right after creation, and requires user authentication, see [InAppWallet.Connect](/dotnet/wallets/providers/in-app-wallet) for more information.

## Usage

```csharp
bool isConnected = await wallet.IsConnected();
```

<Details summary="Return Value">

### bool

Returns a `bool` indicating the wallet's connection status. `true` signifies that the wallet is currently connected and ready to go, whereas `false` indicates it is not.
