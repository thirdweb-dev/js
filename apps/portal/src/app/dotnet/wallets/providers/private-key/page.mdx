# PrivateKeyWallet.Create

Instantiate a `PrivateKeyWallet` with a given private key. This wallet is capable of signing transactions and messages, interacting with smart contracts, and performing other blockchain operations. **This wallet type is intended for backend applications only,** due to the sensitive nature of private keys.

## Usage

```csharp
var wallet = await PrivateKeyWallet.Create(client, "yourPrivateKeyHex");
```

<Callout variant="warning" title="Important">
	This method involves using a raw private key, which should be handled with the
	utmost care. Never expose private keys in client-side code or store them in an
	insecure manner. Ideally, use environment variables or secure vaults to manage
	private keys in backend services.
</Callout>

<Details summary="Parameters">

### client (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebClient`.

### privateKeyHex (required)

The private key of the wallet, provided as a hexadecimal `string`. This key grants full control over the wallet's funds and assets on the blockchain.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">
PrivateKeyWallet

Returns an instance of `PrivateKeyWallet`, ready to sign transactions and messages with the provided private key.

</Details>

## Example

Here is an example of creating a PrivateKeyWallet to sign a simple message. This example assumes you have a ThirdwebClient instance already created:

```csharp
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create("yourClientId");
var privateKeyHex = "yourPrivateKeyHex"; // Should be securely stored and accessed
var wallet = await PrivateKeyWallet.Create(client, privateKeyHex);

Console.WriteLine($"PrivateKeyWallet address: {await wallet.GetAddress()}");

// Sign a message
var message = "Hello, Thirdweb!";
var signature = await wallet.PersonalSign(message);
Console.WriteLine($"Signature: {signature}");
```

**Note**: The `PrivateKeyWallet` is intended for use in secure, backend environments. Ensure private keys are never exposed or hard-coded in client-side applications. Use `InAppWallet` and `SmartWallet` for client-side applications.
