# EngineWallet.Create

A .NET integration of thirdweb [Engine](https://thirdweb.com/engine).

Instantiate a `Engine` with a given private key. This wallet is capable of signing transactions and messages, interacting with smart contracts, and performing other blockchain operations. **This wallet type is intended for backend applications only,** due to the sensitive nature of private keys.

## Usage

```csharp
// EngineWallet is compatible with IThirdwebWallet and can be used with any SDK method/extension
var engineWallet = await EngineWallet.Create(
    client: client,
    engineUrl: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ENGINE_URL"),
    authToken: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ENGINE_ACCESS_TOKEN"),
    walletAddress: Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ENGINE_BACKEND_WALLET_ADDRESS"),
    timeoutSeconds: null, // no timeout
    additionalHeaders: null // can set things like x-account-address if using basic session keys
);

// Simple self transfer
var receipt = await engineWallet.Transfer(chainId: 11155111, toAddress: await engineWallet.GetAddress(), weiAmount: 0);
Console.WriteLine($"Receipt: {receipt}");
```

<Callout variant="warning" title="Important">
	This method involves using an access token, it is meant to be used in a secure backend environment. Never expose access tokens in client-side code or store them in an insecure manner. Ideally, use environment variables or secure vaults to manage access tokens in backend services.
