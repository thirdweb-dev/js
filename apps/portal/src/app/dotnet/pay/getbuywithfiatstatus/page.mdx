# GetBuyWithFiatStatus

Get onramp status for an intent id returned by [BuyWithFiat](/dotnet/pay/buywithfiat).

## Usage

```csharp
using Thirdweb.Pay;

var status = await ThirdwebPay.GetBuyWithFiatStatus(client, _quote.IntentId);
```

In some cases, you may onramp to an intermediary token that requires an additional step, in these cases the `CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED` status indicates that the onramp transfer has completed and you may now use the intent id to trigger a [BuyWithCrypto](/dotnet/pay/buywithcrypto) transaction to get to your destination token. The flow is the same for [GetBuyWithCryptoQuote](/dotnet/pay/getbuywithcryptoquote), though you may now pass the intent id as a parameter to link both statuses together.

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### Client (required)

`ThirdwebClient`: The Thirdweb client instance.

#### Intent ID

`string`: The intent id returned by the quote.
