# ThirdwebContract.Read

Use `ThirdwebContract.Read` to fetch data from a smart contract without making any state changes to the blockchain. This method is primarily used for "view" and "pure" functions within the smart contract.

## Usage

```csharp
// Static
var result = await ThirdwebContract.Read<T>(contract, "methodName", parameters);

// Extension
var result = await contract.Read<T>("methodName", parameters);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### methodName (required)

The name of the contract method you wish to call. Must be a `string`.

### parameters (optional)

The parameters to pass to the contract method, if any. Provide as a comma-separated list following methodName.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### T

Returns the result of the contract method call as type T. The type T should match the expected return type of the smart contract method. For example, if the smart contract method returns an uint256, you should expect to receive a BigInteger in C#.
