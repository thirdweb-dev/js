# ThirdwebContract.Write

The `ThirdwebContract.Write` method allows you to execute transactions that alter the state of the blockchain via a smart contract. This is typically used for functions that create, modify, or delete data on the blockchain.

## Usage

```csharp
var transactionReceipt = await contract.Write(wallet, contract, "methodName", weiValue, parameters);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### wallet (required)

An instance of `IThirdwebWallet`. This represents the signer of the transaction, which can be any type of wallet provider.

### contract (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebContract`. Represents the smart contract you wish to interact with.

### methodName (required)

The name of the smart contract method you intend to call. Must be a `string`.

### weiValue (required)

The amount of Wei to send with payable transactions as a `BigInteger`. This is often set to 0 for methods that don't require sending Ether.

### parameters (optional)

The parameters to pass to the smart contract method, if any. Provide these as a comma-separated list after weiValue.

<Details summary="Return Value">

### TransactionReceipt

Returns the transaction receipt as a `TransactionReceipt` object, which contains information about the executed transaction.

## Example

Let's say you have a smart contract with a `transfer` method that transfers ERC20 tokens from the caller's address to another address. Here's how you could execute a transaction to transfer tokens using `ThirdwebContract.Write`:

```csharp
BigInteger chainId = 1; // Ethereum mainnet
string contractAddress = "0x..."; // Your contract address
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create(secretKey: "yourSecretKey");
var contract = await ThirdwebContract.Create(client, contractAddress, chainId);

// The wallet that signs and sends the transaction
var wallet = await PrivateKeyWallet.Create(client, "yourPrivateKeyHex");

// Assuming transfer takes an address and an amount as parameters
string toAddress = "0x...";
BigInteger amount = new BigInteger(1000); // The amount to transfer

// No ether is being sent in this non-payable transaction, so weiValue is 0
BigInteger weiValue = BigInteger.Zero;

// Executing the transfer
var receipt = await contract.Write(wallet, contract, "transfer", weiValue, toAddress, amount);
Console.WriteLine($"Transaction receipt: {receipt}");
```

This method is essential for interacting with smart contracts when you need to make changes to the blockchain, such as updating state or transferring assets.
