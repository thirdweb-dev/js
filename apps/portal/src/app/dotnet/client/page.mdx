# Initializing a Thirdweb Client

The `ThirdwebClient` class is the main entry point for interacting with the Thirdweb SDK.

You can pass the client to other methods to interact with wallets and smart contracts.

One client unlocks all thirdweb infrastructure services by default.

## Usage

To start interacting with a deployed smart contract using the Thirdweb .NET SDK, first create a `ThirdwebClient` instance. You can create a client using either a `secretKey` for backend applications or a `clientId` for frontend applications. If your application is not web-based (has no origin), you should also provide a `bundleId`.

<Callout variant='info' title="Choosing between clientId and secretKey">

- Use `Client ID` for client-side or frontend applications.
- Use `Secret Key` for server-side or backend applications where you can securely store and use the secret key.
- A `Client ID` should be paired with a `Bundle ID` for non-web applications.

Always ensure that your secret keys are stored securely and not exposed in client-side code.

</Callout>

```csharp
using Thirdweb;

// For native applications
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create(clientId: "yourClientId", bundleId: "yourBundleId");

// For frontend applications
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create(clientId: "yourClientId");

// For backend applications
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create(secretKey: "yourSecretKey");
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

### clientId (optional)

The client ID associated with your thirdweb dashboard API Key.

### secretKey (optional)

The secret key associated with your thirdweb dashboard API Key.

### bundleId (optional)

The bundle ID associated with your thirdweb dashboard API Key. Required for non-web applications and paired with the client ID.

### fetchTimeoutOptions (optional)

Options for configuring timeouts for fetching data. Useful for fine-tuning request performance.

```csharp
// You can choose to override default timeout values for storage, rpc, and other requests.
TimeoutOptions(int? storage = null, int? rpc = null, int? other = null)
```

### rpcOverrides (optional)

Overrides for the default RPC endpoints. Will use your custom endpoints instead of thirdweb RPC endpoints.

```csharp
var client = ThirdwebClient.Create(
    ...,
    rpcOverrides: new()
    {
        { 1, "https://eth.llamarpc.com" },
        { 42161, "https://arbitrum.llamarpc.com" }
    }
);
```
