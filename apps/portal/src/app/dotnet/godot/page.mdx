# Integrating into Godot Projects

To integrate the Thirdweb .NET SDK into your Godot projects, you will need to add the Thirdweb SDK package directly to your Godot project's `.csproj` file. This enables you to use the SDK's functionalities within your Godot application, allowing for blockchain interactions such as connecting to user's wallets, interacting with smart contracts, and more.

## Configuration

### Adding the Package to Your Project

To add the Thirdweb .NET SDK to your Godot project, you will need to manually edit your project's `.csproj` file to include the Thirdweb NuGet package as a dependency. Here is how you can do it:

1. Close your Godot project if it's open in the Godot editor.
2. Locate your project's `.csproj` file in your project directory.
3. Open the `.csproj` file in a text editor.
4. Add the following `PackageReference` inside the `<ItemGroup>` tag that contains other `PackageReference` entries:

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <!-- Other NuGet package references -->
  <PackageReference Include="Thirdweb" Version="1.0.0" />
  <!-- Update with the latest version when necessary -->
</ItemGroup>
```
