# ThirdwebTransaction Static Methods

The `ThirdwebTransaction` class includes several static methods that provide functionality to estimate costs, simulate, send and poll transactions and user operations.

These methods are crucial for advanced transaction management and execution in blockchain applications.

## ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateGasCosts

Estimate the gas costs of a transaction.

```csharp
TotalCosts gasCosts = await ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateGasCosts(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction for which you are estimating the gas costs.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### TotalCosts

Returns the estimated gas costs as `TotalCosts`, including costs in both `ether` and `wei`.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateTotalCosts

Calculate the total costs of a transaction, combining the gas costs and transaction value.

```csharp
TotalCosts totalCosts = await ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateTotalCosts(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction for which you are calculating total costs.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### TotalCosts

Returns the total costs of the transaction as `TotalCosts`, encompassing both the gas costs and the transaction value in `ether` and `wei`.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateGasLimit

Estimate the gas limit of a transaction or user operation.

```csharp
BigInteger estimatedGasLimit = await ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateGasLimit(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction for which you are estimating the gas limit.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### BigInteger

Returns the estimated gas limit as a `BigInteger`.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateGasPrice

Estimate the gas price for a transaction, optionally adjusting the estimate by a bump ratio.

```csharp
BigInteger estimatedGasPrice = await ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateGasPrice(transaction, withBump);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction for which you are estimating the gas price.

### withBump (optional)

A Boolean indicating whether to adjust the estimated gas price by a factor to account for network conditions. Defaults to `true`.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### BigInteger

Returns the estimated gas price as a `BigInteger`.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.Simulate

Simulate the execution of a transaction and return raw data.

```csharp
string data = await ThirdwebTransaction.Simulate(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction you are simulating.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### string

Returns the raw data of the simulated transaction as a `string`.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.Sign

Sign a raw transaction and returns the signed transaction data or the signed user operation json.

```csharp
string signedTx = await ThirdwebTransaction.Sign(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction you are signing.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### string

Returns the signed transaction data as a `string` or the signed user operation json if using Account Abstraction.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.Send

Send a transaction to the blockchain without waiting for confirmation.

```csharp
string transactionHash = await ThirdwebTransaction.Send(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction you want to send to the blockchain.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### string

Returns the hash of the transaction as a `string`.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.SendAndWaitForTransactionReceipt

Send a transaction and wait for its receipt.

```csharp
TransactionReceipt receipt = await ThirdwebTransaction.SendAndWaitForTransactionReceipt(transaction);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### transaction (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebTransaction`. The transaction you are sending and waiting for a receipt.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### TransactionReceipt

Returns the transaction receipt as a `TransactionReceipt`, which includes details of the transaction execution result.

</Details>

## ThirdwebTransaction.WaitForTransactionReceipt

Wait for a transaction receipt to be available. Throws if reverted explicitly or silently and attempts to decode the revert reason.

```csharp
TransactionReceipt receipt = await ThirdwebTransaction.WaitForTransactionReceipt(client, chainId, txHash);
```

<Details summary="Parameters">

### client (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebClient`.

### chainId (required)

The chain ID of the blockchain network where the transaction was sent. Must be a `BigInteger`.

### txHash (required)

The hash of the transaction you are waiting for. Must be a hexadecimal `string`.

### cancellationToken (optional)

A `CancellationToken` to cancel the operation.

</Details>

<Details summary="Return Value">

### TransactionReceipt

Returns the transaction receipt as a `TransactionReceipt`, which includes details of the transaction execution result.

</Details>
