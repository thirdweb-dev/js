# ThirdwebContract.Prepare

`ThirdwebContract.Prepare` bridges contract interactions and the transaction tooling within the Thirdweb .NET SDK. Use it when you want to start from a contract method, but need fine-grained control over the resulting `ThirdwebTransaction` before dispatching it.

<Callout type="info">
Looking for the contract APIs themselves? Check out the [Contracts guides](/dotnet/contracts/create) for creating, reading, and writing before you promote a call into a transaction.
</Callout>

## Why prepare first?

- **Simulation & inspection** – Prepare the transaction and run [`ThirdwebTransaction.Simulate`](/dotnet/transactions/static) before sending.
- **Customization** – Chain the [`ThirdwebTransaction` instance methods](/dotnet/transactions/instance) to adjust calldata, value, gas, or paymaster options.
- **Wallet-agnostic** – Works with any `IThirdwebWallet`, letting you bridge user wallets, smart wallets, or server wallets into the same flow.

## Usage

```csharp
ThirdwebTransaction transaction = await contract.Prepare(
    wallet,
    contract,
    "methodName",
    weiValue,
    parameters
);
```

Once prepared, you can tweak or send the transaction:

```csharp
// Optional: override calldata, value, or other fields
transaction = transaction
    .SetValue(BigInteger.Zero)
    .SetGasLimit(250000);

// Optional: simulate or estimate costs
await ThirdwebTransaction.Simulate(transaction);
var totalCosts = await ThirdwebTransaction.EstimateTotalCosts(transaction);

// Finally: send the transaction and wait for the receipt
TransactionReceipt receipt = await ThirdwebTransaction.SendAndWaitForTransactionReceipt(transaction);
```

## Parameters

<Details summary="Prepare parameters">

### wallet (required)

An instance of `IThirdwebWallet`. This signer provides the context for populating sender-specific defaults and will ultimately authorize the transaction.

### contract (required)

An instance of `ThirdwebContract`. Represents the smart contract whose method you're calling.

### methodName (required)

The name of the contract method to invoke. Must be a `string`.

### weiValue (required)

The amount of Wei to send with the transaction, as a `BigInteger`. Use `BigInteger.Zero` when no value transfer is needed.

### parameters (optional)

The arguments to forward to the contract method. Provide them in the same order as the ABI definition.

</Details>

## Return value

<Details summary="ThirdwebTransaction">

Returns a fully populated `ThirdwebTransaction` that mirrors the contract invocation. You can send it immediately or pipe it through additional configuration helpers before execution.
