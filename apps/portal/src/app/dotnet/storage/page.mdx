# ThirdwebStorage

The `ThirdwebStorage` class provides methods to interact with any URL including IPFS, allowing you to download and upload data easily.

## Download

Download data from an HTTP or IPFS URI.

```csharp
var data = await ThirdwebStorage.Download<string>(client, "{{uri}}");
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

### uri

The IPFS URI or a URL that points to the data.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

Returns the data as the specified type. If you're downloading a string, such as JSON data, it's directly returned. For other types, the method attempts to deserialize the data to the specified type using `Newtonsoft.Json`.

</Details>

## Upload

Upload file to IPFS and pin it.

```csharp
var result = await ThirdwebStorage.Upload(client, "{{path/to-file}}");
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

### path

The path to the file to upload.

Must be a `string`.

### Return Value

Returns an `IPFSUploadResult` containing the IPFS hash (IpfsHash), the size of the pinned content (PinSize), the timestamp of the pinning (Timestamp), and a preview URL (PreviewUrl) constructed using the client ID and the IPFS hash.

</Details>

## UploadRaw

Upload raw data to IPFS and pin it.

```csharp
var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("{{data}}");
var result = await ThirdwebStorage.UploadRaw(client, bytes);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

### rawBytes

The raw data to upload.

Must be a `byte[]`.

### Return Value

Returns an `IPFSUploadResult` containing the IPFS hash (IpfsHash), the size of the pinned content (PinSize), the timestamp of the pinning (Timestamp), and a preview URL (PreviewUrl) constructed using the client ID and the IPFS hash.

## Example Usage

### Downloading JSON Data

```csharp
var jsonData = await ThirdwebStorage.Download<Dictionary<string, object>>(client, "ipfs://Qm...");
```

var uploadResult = await ThirdwebStorage.Upload(client, @"C:\path\to\your\file.txt");
Console.WriteLine($"IPFS Hash: {uploadResult.IpfsHash}");
```
