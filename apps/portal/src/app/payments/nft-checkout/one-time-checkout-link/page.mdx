# One-Time Checkout Link

A one-time Checkout Link is a prebuilt checkout experience that is customized per buyer by providing a fixed price, email, wallet address, quantity, and more.

Each unique link allows at most one purchase and expires after the specified duration.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you've [enabled your contract for Payments](enable-contract).

## Use cases

- Gate purchases via an off-chain allowlist. After verifying the buyer's identity on your app, navigate them to the checkout link.
- Implement dynamic pricing by passing in the price for each checkout. This feature allows you to provide coupon codes, bulk discounts, and loyalty discounts.
- Restrict the quantity of NFTs your buyers can purchase.
- Directly email the checkout URL directly to the buyer's inbox.
