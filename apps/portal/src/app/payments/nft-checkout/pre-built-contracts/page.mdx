# Pre-built Contracts

## Integration

For some thirdweb contracts, set `contractArgs` when creating [Shareable Checkout Links](/payments/nft-checkout/checkout-link), [One-Time Checkout Links](/payments/nft-checkout/one-time-checkout-link), or [Checkout Elements](/payments/nft-checkout/elements).

See guide: [Create an ERC721A NFT Drop with Signature-Based Minting](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/signature-drop/)

### NFT Drop

This is an ERC-721A contract where the NFT metadata is unique but the claim configuration is identical for all buyers. No `contractArgs` should be set.

### Edition Drop

This is an ERC-1155 contract where the NFT metadata and claim configuration is identical for all buyers. Set `contractArgs` with the token ID to mint:

```typescript
contractArgs = { tokenId: "0" };
```

### Marketplace

This is a contract that allows other users to purchase already-minted NFTs. Set `contractArgs` with an array of the marketplace listing IDs of each of the direct listing:

```typescript
contractArgs = {
  listings: [
    { listingId: "0" },
    { listingId: "1" },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Configure the Claim Condition

Your thirdweb contract must have at least one active claim condition, meaning the **When will this phase start?** date is in the past.

| **When will this phase start?**                                   | thirdweb can only mint NFTs after this date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **How many NFTs will you drop in this phase?**                    | Remember to create NFTs on the **NFTs** tab for NFT Drop contracts.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **How much do you want to charge to claim each NFT?**             | For Goerli, this price must be â‰¤ 0.0001 ETH. <br /><br />On production, there is a $2,000 price limit. Please fill out [this Typeform](https://fw3786mcxwl.typeform.com/to/B0xIFoiu) to request an increase. |
| **What currency do you want to use?**                             | Supported currencies on thirdweb:  - Polygon: MATIC, USDC, WETH <br />- Goerli: ETH <br />- Ethereum: ETH, USDC                                                                                                                        |
| **Who can claim NFTs during this phase?**                         | If you have an allowlist, please add thirdweb's minter wallets. <br />Otherwise leave this blank.                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **How many seconds do wallets have to wait in-between claiming?** | This value must be 0.
