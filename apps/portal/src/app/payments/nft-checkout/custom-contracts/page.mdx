# Custom Contracts

Using your own Custom Contract on Polygon, Ethereum, or another EVM blockchain? The following example shows you how to use it with thirdweb.

## Example

Assume that this is your contract's claim function:

```javascript
function claimTo(
   address _to,
   uint256 _quantity,
   uint256 _tokenId,
   string CUSTOM_ARG_1, // Any additional arguments.
   bool CUSTOM_ARG_2
)
    external
    payable
    mintCompliant(_tokenId, _quantity)
    priceCompliant(_tokenId, _quantity)
    tokenLive(_tokenId)
  {
    // YOUR MINTING LOGIC HERE
  }
```

You will then need a **mintMethod** in order for thirdweb to call your claim function. For the example above, your mintMethod should look like this:

```json
mintMethod: {
  name: "claimTo", // Name of the function to call within the smart contract.
  args: {
    _to: "$WALLET",
    _quantity: "$QUANTITY",
    _tokenId: 0,
    CUSTOM_ARG_1: "xyz",
    CUSTOM_ARG_2: false
  },
  payment: {
    value: "0.1 * $QUANTITY", // Assuming that your NFT costs 0.1 ETH each.
    currency: "ETH"
  }
}
```

This will ensure that when thirdweb calls the smart contract during any checkout flow, under the hood, we would be calling your smart contract like so:

```javascript
claimTo("0x...", 1, 0, "xyz", false {
  value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1"),
});
```

## Requirements

Your smart contract method that mints the NFT must satisfy these requirements:

1. The method must accept the buyer's wallet address as an argument.
2. The method must allow thirdweb's minter wallets to mint an unlimited amount as the `msg.sender`. Any restrictions on the minting wallet address or quantity is not allowed.
3. (If priced in USDC) The method must explicitly [request USDC token](/payments/nft-checkout/erc20-pricing) from the `msg.sender`.

## MintMethod

The **mintMethod** is required when creating [Shareable Checkout Links](/payments/nft-checkout/checkout-link), [One-Time Checkout Links](/payments/nft-checkout/one-time-checkout-link), or [Checkout Elements](/payments/nft-checkout/elements). Think of it as an ABI for thirdweb to know how to call your claim function.

The generic format of the mintMethod is:

```json
"mintMethod": {
  "name": "claimTo",
  "args": {
    "_to": "$WALLET",
    "_quantity": "$QUANTITY"
  },
  "payment": {
    "value": "0.1 * $QUANTITY",
    "currency": "ETH"
  }
}
```

## Template variables

> ðŸš§ Don't know the values?
>
> thirdweb supports two template variables -`$WALLET` and `$QUANTITY` that you may use if you don't know the buyer's wallet address and quantity. Note that for **all other** fields such as `value` and `currency`, you would need to hardcode the actual values.

Template variables will be replaced when calling your contract:

| Variable    | Replaced with                   |
| :---------- | :------------------------------ |
| `$WALLET`   | The buyer's wallet address.     |
| `$QUANTITY` | The quantity of tokens to mint. |

## Payment

The `payment` field should provide the **price per NFT in human-readable form** (not wei).

Example: `"payment": { "value": "0.1 * $QUANTITY", "currency": "ETH" }`

### Free NFTs

Set the price to zero.

Example: `"payment": { value: "0 * $QUANTITY", currency: "MATIC" }`

### NFTs priced in USDC

Ensure your mint method **explicitly requests USDC tokens from msg.sender**. See [USDC Pricing](/payments/nft-checkout/erc20-pricing) for more details.

### Delegate a different ERC-20 payment address

> ðŸ“˜ This is required when interacting with the [Seaport contract](https://docs.opensea.io/reference/seaport-overview).

By default thirdweb's float wallet approves your NFT contract to request ERC-20 tokens.
To specify a different contract address that will request ERC-20 tokens from thirdweb's float wallet, set that address in the `"spender"` field:

```json
"payment": {
  "value": "100 * $QUANTITY",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "spender": "<PAYMENT CONTRACT ADDRESS>"
}
```

## FAQ

### I have multiple methods with the same name. Why isn't my mintMethod isn't working?

Please provide the full signature as your mintMethod. thirdweb will not try to "guess" the correct method.

> **Example**
>
> Your contract has methods `mint(address to)` and `mint(address to, string tokenId)` and your checkout will call the former.
>
> Provide your mintMethod as `mint(address)`.

You **do not** need to modify your contract.
