# Marketplaces

thirdweb supports marketplace contracts where a user can list an NFT and receive funds when a buyer purchases it.

Integration is identical to a checkout using a `CUSTOM_CONTRACT` contract type. Follow the guide on integrating [custom contracts](custom-contracts), and ensure the `mintMethod` identifies the method on your smart contract that purchases the NFT (a "buy" method).

Your contract method should do the following:

- Accepts the wallet address where the NFT should be delivered.
- Accepts payment in the chain's native coin or [USDC / ERC-20 tokens](erc20-pricing) from the caller (`msg.sender`) of the method.
- Transfers the NFT from the seller to the recipient's wallet address. Remember: `msg.sender` is thirdweb's minter wallet and not the buyer's wallet address. Your function needs to ensure the recipient is specified in the argument list.

## Third-party marketplaces

Checkouts also supports purchases of tokens listed on third-party Marketplaces such as OpenSea, LooksRare, or X2Y2.

Purchases on third-party marketplaces are facilitated by the [Reservoir](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs) contract. You can create a Checkout for an item listed on any [supported Reservoir marketplace](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/supported-marketplaces).

## Integration

1. Register a new contract
   1. Set your **Contract Type** to **Reservoir**.
   2. Leave **Contract Address** blank.
2. Create a checkout link with the ID of the registered contract. We recommend using one-time checkout links as the underlying token listed on third-party marketplaces may sell out.

### Code sample

```typescript
const body = {
  contractId: "REGISTERED_CONTRACT_ID", // this contract should be registered with Reservoir as the contract type
  title: "My Checkout",
  contractArgs: {
	  // TIP! You can add more than 1 token to the nfts array and we'll accept all of those listings!
    nfts: [
      { token: `COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_1:TOKEN_ID_1` },
      { token: `COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS_2:TOKEN_ID_2` }
    ]
  },
};

const resp = await fetch("https://payments.thirdweb.com/api/2022-08-12/checkout-link-intent", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: [
    "Authorization": "Bearer MY_THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  ]
  body: JSON.stringify(body);
});
const { checkoutLinkIntentUrl } = await resp.body();

// Navigate users to this URL to purchase your NFT.

```

Please update the following variables:

- `REGISTERED_CONTRACT_ID`: The Contract ID from Step 1.
- `COLLECTION_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The contract address of the NFT collection.
- `TOKEN_ID`: The token ID of the NFT from the listing. This listing must exist on one of Reservoir's supported marketplaces.
- `MY_THIRDWEB_API_SECRET_KEY` found on your API Keys dashboard page.

For a more embedded and branded checkout experience, you may also sell marketplace NFTs with [Checkout Elements](elements).
