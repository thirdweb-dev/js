# Find Routes

Use thirdweb's `Bridge.routes` utility to find all routes between tokens.

    ### Get All Routes

    Retrieve all supported routes:

    ```typescript
    import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

    const routes = await Bridge.routes({
      client,
    });
    ```

    This returns an array of route objects with information about supported token pairs:

    ```typescript
    [
      {
        destinationToken: {
          address: "0x12c88a3C30A7AaBC1dd7f2c08a97145F5DCcD830",
          chainId: 1,
          decimals: 18,
          iconUri: "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/37207/standard/G.jpg",
          name: "G7",
          symbol: "G7",
        },
        originToken: {
          address: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
          chainId: 480,
          decimals: 18,
          iconUri: "https://assets.relay.link/icons/1/light.png",
          name: "Ether",
          symbol: "ETH",
        }
      },
      // ... more routes
    ]
    ```

    ### Filter Routes by Origin

    Get all routes starting from a specific chain and token:

    ```typescript
    import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

    // Get all routes starting from mainnet ETH
    const routes = await Bridge.routes({
      originChainId: 1,
      originTokenAddress: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
      client,
    });
    ```

    ### Filter Routes by Destination

    Find routes that end at a specific destination:

    ```typescript
    import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

    // Get all routes ending at USDC on Optimism
    const routes = await Bridge.routes({
      destinationChainId: 10,
      destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85",
      client,
    });
    ```

    ### Filter Routes by Both Origin and Destination

    Find direct routes between specific token pairs:

    ```typescript
    import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

    // Get routes from mainnet ETH to USDC on Optimism
    const routes = await Bridge.routes({
      originChainId: 1,
      originTokenAddress: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
      destinationChainId: 10,
      destinationTokenAddress: "0x0b2C639c533813f4Aa9D7837CAf62653d097Ff85",
      client,
    });
    ```

    ### Pagination

    For large result sets, use pagination to retrieve routes in chunks:

    ```typescript
    import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

    // Get the first 10 routes starting from mainnet ETH
    const routes = await Bridge.routes({
      originChainId: 1,
      originTokenAddress: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
      limit: 10,
      offset: 0,
      client,
    });

    // Get the next 10 routes
    const nextRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
      originChainId: 1,
      originTokenAddress: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
      limit: 10,
      offset: 10,
      client,
    });
    ```

    ### Limit Route Complexity

    Control the maximum number of steps in the returned routes:

    ```typescript
    import { Bridge } from "thirdweb";

    // Get only direct routes (1 step)
    const directRoutes = await Bridge.routes({
      originChainId: 1,
      originTokenAddress: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
      maxSteps: 1,
      client,
    });
    ```
