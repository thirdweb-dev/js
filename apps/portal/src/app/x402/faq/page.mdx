# x402 FAQ

## General

<Details summary="When do I use a client or server side integration?">
Use client-side integration when end users are paying directly from their own wallets. For example, in applications or AI agents where users sign transactions themselves.

Use server-side integration when your backend or service handles payments such as when sponsoring user payments, automating paid API calls, or keeping API keys and logic secure.
