# Webhooks

You can create webhooks to receive notifications for contract events such as token transfers or state changes or for blockchain transactions on any contract.

With webhooks, you'll receive event data in real-time without making constant requests, reducing RPC load and the risk of missing events.

## Use Cases

Your app may trigger an action when an onchain event occurs, such as:

- ETH or an ERC20 currency is transferred to or from a wallet.
- A token is minted from your NFT collection.
- A token in your NFT collection is burned or transferred.
- Metadata for an oracle contract is updated.

## Create Webhooks

You can configure token webhooks from the dashboard by navigating to your project and selecting Tokens > Webhooks
