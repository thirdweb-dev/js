# Contracts FAQs

<Details summary="Why can I no longer deploy a pack contract?">
Pack contracts were officially deprecated after the Pectra release from Ethereum. The pack contract implementation is incompatible with the Pectra update, which introduced breaking changes to the Ethereum protocol. As a result, support for pack contracts has been removed from thirdweb's deployment tools to ensure compatibility and security.

If you need similar functionality, consider using:
- **Edition Drop contracts** for distributing multiple quantities of NFTs
- **Marketplace contracts** for trading and bundle functionality
- **Custom smart contracts** built with our modular contract framework

For existing pack contracts, they will continue to function on-chain, but new deployments are no longer supported.
