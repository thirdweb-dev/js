# Tokens FAQs

<Details summary="What are the benefits of deploying through the Tokens UI instead of previous thirdweb contracts?">

<Details summary="Are the token contracts audited?">

</Details>

<Details summary="What is the difference between an ERC-721 and ERC-1155 token?">
ERC-721 tokens represent unique, one-of-a-kind assets where each token has its own ID and metadata (like an NFT artwork). ERC-1155 tokens are more flexible, allowing both unique (non-fungible) and identical (fungible) assets to exist under one smart contract. This is ideal for gaming items or collections with multiple editions.

<Details summary="How do I renounce ownership of my token contract?">
You can call the `renounceOwnership` function on your asset contract (e.g., via a block explorer).

- _Native token value to enter:_ `0`
- _Note:_ Renouncing ownership is irreversible and means you will no longer be able to update the contract or its metadata.
</Details>

<Details summary="What are the implications of renouncing ownership?">
After renouncing ownership, you lose all admin privileges, including the ability to update token metadata or manage contract settings.
