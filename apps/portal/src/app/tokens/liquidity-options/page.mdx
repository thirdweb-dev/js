# Token Liquidity Options

When creating an ERC-20 token with thirdweb, you have a few options for adding liquidity or pricing strategies to your token. 
Liquidity is essential for enabling trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and ensuring that users can buy and sell your token easily.

## Liquidity Options

### Bonding Curve

A bonding curve lets your token’s price automatically adjust based on supply. As more tokens get bought (supply goes down), the price goes up — and when tokens are sold (supply goes up), the price goes down.
It’s great for tokens that want a built-in price mechanism without relying on traditional liquidity pools. Think of it as a self-balancing vending machine for your token.

### Dynamic Bonding Curve (Coming Soon)

This works like a regular bonding curve but gives you extra control over how the curve behaves. You can tweak parameters like slope, limits, and responsiveness to market activity.
This option is perfect if you want your token to adapt to demand cycles, grow with your community, or react to specific economic conditions without manual intervention.

### Fixed Price (Coming Soon)

A fixed price means your token sells at one set amount until you change it. No fancy math, no curve — just a stable price.
This is ideal for presales, early community distributions, or situations where you don’t want price volatility yet. Once you’re ready, you can later introduce more advanced pricing or liquidity mechanisms.
