# Loyalty Card

The Loyalty Card contract is suitable for launching loyalty programs. Each NFT represents a loyalty card, and the NFT's metadata contains the loyalty card's information.

A loyalty card's **metadata can be updated by an admin** of the contract. A loyalty card can be cancelled (i.e. 'burned') by its owner or an approved operator. A loyalty card can be revoked (i.e. 'burned') without its owner's approval, by an admin of the contract. By default, loyalty cards are non-transferrable NFTs.

Loyalty cards can be minted to users via signature minting.
