# Edition

The **Edition** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs based on the same asset, but you **don't** want to "drop" or "release" them for your community to claim.

Unlike the [Edition Drop](/pre-built-contracts/edition-drop) contract, the Edition contract does not **lazy mint** your NFTs. Instead, NFTs are minted immediately when they are added to the collection.

This means you can still transfer the NFTs or sell them on a [Marketplace](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) and perform any other actions you would expect to do with an NFT.

For advanced use-cases, the Edition also has [signature-based minting](/glossary/signature-based-minting) capabilities.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Edition contract to:

- Create an NFT Collection where each NFT has 100 copies
- Airdrop an NFT to a list of addresses that all use the same asset and metadata
- Create 10 "copies" of your artwork and sell them on a [Marketplace](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)

## Creating & Configuring the Edition

Learn how to create and configure your smart contract using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team).

### Creating an Edition Contract

Deploy the edition contract to any EVM network using the button below.

### Minting NFTs

Click **Mint** to create a single NFT.

You can add additional supply to an existing NFT by clicking on that NFT and clicking **Mint**:

### Airdrop NFTs

Click on the token you want to use, navigate to the **Airdrop** tab,
and upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.
You can download our example [CSV File](https://thirdweb.com/assets/examples/airdrop.csv) to get started.

### Contract Metadata

### Royalty & Platform Fees

From the **Settings** tab, you also configure the royalty fee,
primary sales recipient,
and platform fee.
