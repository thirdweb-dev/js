# Airdrop ERC-20

Airdrop ERC-20 tokens or the chain's native token (e.g. ether for Ethereum mainnet) to a list of recipients.

The `AirdropERC20` contract is suitable to use when you want to transfer ERC20 tokens or native tokens to a list of recipient addresses, where these recipients are not expected to individually claim their airdrop; they just receive it in a transfer.
When airdropping tokens with this contract, you specify:

- The address of the ERC20 token being transferred. (For native tokens, the address used is `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`)
- The address from which the token will be transferred to a list of the recipients.
- An array of objects containing recipient-address and token-amounts, for e.g.

```typescript
[
	{
		recipient: "0x123...",
		amount: 1, // these amounts are in wei
	},
	{
		recipient: "0xabc...",
		amount: 10, // these amounts are in wei
	},
];
```

note: token-owner must approve their tokens to this airdrop contract, by calling approval related function on the ERC20 token contract.

**Estimated gas costs for airdropping tokens:**
Cost of airdropping `1` ERC20 token: ~`66,600` gas. Cost of airdropping each additional ERC20 token: ~`32,526` gas.
