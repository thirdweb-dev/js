# Airdrop ERC1155

Airdrop ERC1155 NFTs to a list of recipients.

The `AirdropERC1155` contract is suitable to use when you want to transfer ERC1155 NFTs to a list of recipient addresses, where these recipients are not expected to individually claim their airdrop; they just receive it in a transfer.
When airdropping tokens with this contract, you specify:

- The address of the Edition (ERC-1155 contract) from which NFTs are being transferred.
- The owner address of the NFTs from where the NFTs will be transferred to a list of the recipients.
- An array of objects containing recipient-address, token-ids, and amounts for e.g.

```typescript
[
	{
		recipient: "0x123...",
		tokenId: 1,
		amount: 5,
	},
	{
		recipient: "0xabc...",
		tokenId: 1,
		amount: 5,
	},
];
```

note: token-owner must approve their tokens to this airdrop contract, by calling approval related functions on the ERC1155 contract.

**Estimated gas costs for airdropping tokens:**
Cost of airdropping `1` ERC1155 token: ~`51,571` gas. Cost of airdropping each additional ERC1155 token: ~`42,672` gas.
