# PlatformFee

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/extension/PlatformFee.sol";
```

`PlatformFee` allows you to charge a percentage fee wherever there is a transfer of currency (ERC20 tokens or native tokens) in your contract.

<GithubButtonLink href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/extension/PlatformFee.sol" />

## Usage

The `PlatformFee` extension is an _abstract contract_, and expects you to implement the following functions by yourself:

| Name                                                                                               | Type                    | Returns | Description                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`_canSetPlatformFeeInfo`](/contracts/build/extensions/general/PlatformFee#_cansetplatformfeeinfo) | internal view _virtual_ | `bool`  | Runs on every attempt to set a new platform fee recipient or bps. Returns whether this info can be set in the given execution context. |

This is an example smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

    address public deployer;

    }

    /**

     *  You MUST complete the body of this function to use the `PlatformFee` extension.

        return msg.sender == deployer;

## Base Contracts Implementing This Extension

## Full API reference

<Details summary="getPlatformFeeInfo">

```solidity
function getPlatformFeeInfo() public view returns (address, uint16);
```

- Returns the platform fee recipient and bps.
- Set this value using the `setPlatformFeeInfo` function.

</Details>

<Details summary="setPlatformFeeInfo">

```solidity
function setPlatformFeeInfo(address platformFeeRecipient, uint256 platformFeeBps) external;
```

- Lets an authorized wallet set the platform fee recipient and bps.
- Parameter `platformFeeRecipient`: The address to set as the new platform fee recipient.
- Parameter `platformFeeBps`: The value to set as the new platform fee BPS.
- The `_canSetPlatformFeeInfo` function is run on every call to this function. If the return value of `_canSetPlatformFeeInfo` is `false`, the `setPlatformFeeInfo` call will revert.

</Details>

<Details summary="_setupPlatformFeeInfo">

```solidity
function _setupPlatformFeeInfo(address platformFeeRecipient, uint256 platformFeeBps) internal;
```

- Sets the platform fee recipient and bps.
- Parameter `platformFeeRecipient`: The address to set as the new platform fee recipient.
- Parameter `platformFeeBps`: The value to set as the new platform fee BPS.
- The `_canSetPlatformFeeInfo` function is _not_ run on a call to this function.

</Details>

<Details summary="_canSetPlatformFeeInfo">

```solidity
function _canSetPlatformFeeInfo() internal view virtual returns (bool);
```

- Runs on every `setPlatformFeeInfo` function call.
- Returns whether a new platform fee recipient or bps can be set in the given execution context.
- For example, this function can check whether the wallet calling `setPlatformFeeInfo` is the contract owner, and enforce that only the current owner should be able to successfully call `setPlatformFeeInfo`.
