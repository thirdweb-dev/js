# Build (Solidity SDK)

**Build** or **Solidity SDK** provides the tools needed to build custom smart contracts more efficiently by offering a set of pre-built base contracts and reusable components, better known as extensions.

#### Features

- **Supports popular EIPs:** Effortlessly integrate common smart contract features and functionality from popular EIPs such as ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-1155, permissions, metadata, and more.
- **Open Source:** The Solidity SDK is open-source and therefore available for any user to audit or contribute to the repository. [View the contracts repository.](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts)
- **Gas-optimized and audited base contracts:** Using base contracts provides a gas-optimized and audited foundation to build your projects.
- **Unlocked Management & Building Tools:** Each inherited extension unlocks easy-to-use functions in the contract interaction SDKs, custom admin dashboards, and tailored data feeds.
