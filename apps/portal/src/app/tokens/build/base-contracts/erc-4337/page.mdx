# ERC-4337 Smart Accounts

All of thirdweb's [smart accounts](/connect/account-abstraction) are [EIP-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart contract accounts with role-based permission control.

Users can deploy a smart accounts for individual use, and app developers can issue smart accounts to their users programmatically.

thirdweb's smart accounts have the following features by default:

- Have multiple owners
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens.
- Send and receive ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.
- Multicall-able.
- Store contract metadata.

thirdweb offers the following three different kinds of account factories:

## Simple smart accounts

**[`Account.sol`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/account) & [`AccountFactory.sol`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/account-factory)**

The `Account` contract is a simple smart account that comes with all the basic benefits of account abstraction, along with the mentioned default features.

App developers can issue [`Account`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/account) smart accounts programmatically by deploying an [`AccountFactory`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/account-factory) smart contract.

The `Account` smart contract is _non-upgradeable_. Developers should use this wallet if they do not anticipate making any future upgrades to their users’ wallets.

## Managed smart accounts

**[`ManagedAccount.sol`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account) & [`ManagedAccountFactory.sol`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account-factory)**

The `ManagedAccount` smart account is an _upgradeable_ smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

App developers can issue `ManagedAccount` smart accounts programmatically by deploying a [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account-factory) smart contract.

The admin of the [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account-factory) contract can push upgrades to all `ManagedAccount` that it creates. This admin does not require any permissions on the `ManagedAccount` smart accounts to do so. An upgrade to the features of `ManagedAccount` applies to _all_ `ManagedAccount` smart accounts created by the factory. This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate _pushing upgrades_ to their users’ wallets.

#### Example use case of push upgrades:

An app wants its user wallets to only be able to own NFTs within its ecosystem. This would be an upgrade to the smart account's `onERC721Received` and `onERC1155Received` transfer hooks.

The app can enforce this behaviour by pushing this upgrade to its user wallets.
