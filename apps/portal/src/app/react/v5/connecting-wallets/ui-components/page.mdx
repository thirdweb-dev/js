# UI Components

You can use [`ConnectButton`](/react/v5/ConnectButton) or [`ConnectEmbed`](/react/v5/ConnectEmbed) component for a quick, easy and customizable UI.

These components provide a beautiful UI for connecting various wallets and take care of a lot of wallet-specific edge cases - so you can focus on building your app.

These components support over 300+ wallets, including support in-app wallets and account abstraction.

It also automatically shows all installed `EIP-6963` compliant wallet extensions installed by the user.

The SDK supports 350+ wallets out of the box, all you need to pass is their id.

<Stack>

<ArticleIconCard
	title="Supported Wallets"
	icon={ComponentIcon}
	href="/typescript/v5/supported-wallets"
	description="See all 350+ wallets supported by the Connect SDK"
/>

</Stack>

## Post Connection

Once the wallet is connected, you can use the [Wallet Connection hooks](/references/typescript/v5/hooks#wallet-connection) to get information about the connected wallet like getting the address, account, etc
