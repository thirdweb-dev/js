# Sponsor Transactions

By using [Account abstraction](/connect/account-abstraction) or [In-App Wallets](/connect/in-app-wallet/overview), you can sponsor all gas costs for your users transactions.

<Callout title="Sponsored transactions" variant="info">

To set up sponsored transactions, set the `sponsorGas` option to `true` in the smart account configuration.
All transactions performed with the smart account will then be sponsored by your application. Testnet transactions are free, but you need a valid credit card on file for mainnet transactions.

## Sponsor transactions for all in-app wallets

To enable account abstraction for in-app wallets, you need to add the `smartAccount` prop with the `inAppWallet` creation.

```jsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const wallets = [inAppWallet({
	smartAccount: {
		chain: sepolia,
		sponsorGas: true,
	},
})];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton
				client={client}
				wallets={wallets}
			/>
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

This will create an in-app wallet and a smart account for the user. The smart account will be initialized with the in-app wallet as the owner.

You can sponsor transactions simply by passing `sponsrGas: true` to the `smartAccount` prop. This will allow the smart account to send transactions without the user needing to hold any ETH.

## Sponsor transactions for all connected wallets

To sponsor transactions for all connected wallets, you can use the `sponsorGas` prop on the `ConnectButton` or `useConnect` hook.

```jsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
 
const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
});
 
export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton
        client={client}
        accountAbstraction={{
          chain: sepolia, // the chain where your smart accounts will be or is deployed
          sponsorGas: true, // enable or disable sponsored transactions
        }}
      />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```

or with the `useConnect` hook:

```jsx
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";
 
function App() {
  // 1. set the `accountAbstraction` configuration to convert wallets to smart accounts
  const { connect } = useConnect({
    client,
    accountAbstraction: {
      chain: sepolia, // the chain where your smart accounts will be or is deployed
      sponsorGas: true, // enable or disable sponsored transactions
    },
  });
 
  const connectToSmartAccount = async () => {
    // 2. connect with the admin wallet of the smart account
    connect(async () => {
      const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask"); // or any other wallet
      await wallet.connect({
        client,
        chain: sepolia,
      });
      return wallet;
    });
  };
 
  return (
    <button onClick={() => connectToSmartAccount()}>Connect</button>
  );
}
```

Once connected, all transactions sent via the `useSendTransaction` hook or the `TransactionButton` component will be sponsored.
