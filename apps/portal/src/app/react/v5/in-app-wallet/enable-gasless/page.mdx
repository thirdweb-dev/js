# Sponsor Transactions

By combining [Account abstraction](/connect/account-abstraction) and [In-App Wallet](/connect/in-app-wallet/overview), you can create a truly seamless user experience:

- Gasless transactions sponsored by your application
- Batched transactions
- Full account recovery the user "account"

## Configure in-app wallet for sponsored transactions

To enable account abstraction in your app, you need to add the `smartAccount` prop with the `inAppWallet` creation.

```jsx
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const wallets = [inAppWallet({
	smartAccount: {
		chain: sepolia,
		sponsorGas: true,
	},
})];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton
				client={client}
				wallets={wallets}
			/>
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

This will create an in-app wallet and a smart account for the user. The smart account will be initialized with the in-app wallet as the owner.

You can sponsor transactions simply by passing `sponsrGas: true` to the `smartAccount` prop. This will allow the smart account to send transactions without the user needing to hold any ETH.
