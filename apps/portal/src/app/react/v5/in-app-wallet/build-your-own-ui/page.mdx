# Build your own UI

## Low level control to authenticate and connect wallets

You have full control with the connection hooks and functions to build your own UI. To use in-app wallets, you first choose a authentication strategy and then connect.

## Setup the ThirdwebProvider

This will ensure that the wallet is available to all components in your app, handle connection states and auto-connection on page load.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

<ThirdwebProvider>
	<YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

## Authenticate via Google

Note that for Apple and Facebook, you just need to update the strategy to "facebook" or "apple".

In React and React Native, the `useConnect()` hook handles authentication and connection states.

```tsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "google",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

Other social options include Apple, Facebook, Discord, Farcaster and more.

## Authenticate via Email verification

```typescript
import { inAppWallet, preAuthenticate } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const preLogin = async (email: string) => {
	// send email verification code
	await preAuthenticate({
		client,
		strategy: "email",
		email, // ex: user@example.com
	});
};

const handleLogin = async (email: string, verificationCode: string) => {
	// verify email and connect
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "email",
			email,
			verificationCode,
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

## Authenticate via Phone number verification

```typescript
import { inAppWallet, preAuthenticate } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const preLogin = async (phonNumber: string) => {
	// send phone number verification code
	await preAuthenticate({
		client,
		strategy: "phone",
		phonNumber, // ex: +1234567890
	});
};

const handleLogin = async (phonNumber: string, verificationCode: string) => {
	// verify phone number and connect
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "phone",
			phonNumber,
			verificationCode,
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

## Authenticate via Passkey

```typescript
import { inAppWallet, hasStoredPasskey } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		const hasPasskey = await hasStoredPasskey(client);
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "passkey",
			type: hasPasskey ? "sign-in" : "sign-up",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```
