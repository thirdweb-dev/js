# In-App Wallets

Create in-app wallet for your users based on their email, phone, passkey, social auth or even their external wallets. These wallets are scoped by your clientId and do not require any confirmation to sign transactions. 

## Available auth methods

## Configure in-app wallets

The simplest way to create an in-app wallet is to use the `inAppWallet()` function. By default, this will create a wallet that supports email/password login, Google, Apple, Facebook login, and passkey.

```tsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = inAppWallet();
```

You can also customize the wallet by passing in options.

```tsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = inAppWallet({
	auth: {
        mode, // options are "popup" | "redirect" | "window";
        options, // ex: ["discord", "farcaster", "apple", "facebook", "google", "passkey"],
        passkeyDomain, // for passkey, the domain that the passkey is created on
        redirectUrl, // the URL to redirect to after authentication
	},
	metadata, // metadata for the wallet (name, icon, etc.)
	smartAccount, // smart account options for the wallet (for gasless tx)
});
```

[View all in-app wallet options](/references/typescript/v5/InAppWalletCreationOptions).

Once created, you can use it either with the prebuilt UI components, or with your own UI.

## Usage with Connect UI components

The easiest way to use in-app wallets is using the prebuilt connect UI components like [`ConnectButton`](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButton) and [`ConnectEmbed`](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectEmbed) to authenticate users and connect their wallets.

By default, the connect UI supports multiple social logins as well as email, phone and passkey authentication. You can customize which authentication methods to support which will be reflected in the UI.

<Callout variant="info" title="Authentication Order">
	By default, email login is displayed before phone number login. To display phone number first, add "phone" before "email" in the providers array
</Callout>


```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });
const wallets = [inAppWallet({
	auth: { options: ["email", "passkey", "google"] }
})];

export default function App() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider>
			<ConnectButton client={client} wallets={wallets} />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
}
```

## Usage with your own UI

You have full control with the connection hooks and functions to build your own UI. Pick an authentication strategy and then connect.

### Setup the ThirdwebProvider

This will ensure that the wallet is available to all components in your app, handle connection states and auto-connection on page load.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

<ThirdwebProvider>
	<YourApp />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

### Authenticate via Google

Note that for Apple and Facebook, you just need to update the strategy to "facebook" or "apple".

In React and React Native, the `useConnect()` hook handles authentication and connection states.

```tsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "google",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

Other social options include Apple, Facebook, Discord, Farcaster and more.

### Authenticate via Email verification

```typescript
import { inAppWallet, preAuthenticate } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const preLogin = async (email: string) => {
	// send email verification code
	await preAuthenticate({
		client,
		strategy: "email",
		email, // ex: user@example.com
	});
};

const handleLogin = async (email: string, verificationCode: string) => {
	// verify email and connect
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "email",
			email,
			verificationCode,
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

### Authenticate via Phone number verification

```typescript
import { inAppWallet, preAuthenticate } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const preLogin = async (phoneNumber: string) => {
	// send phone number verification code
	await preAuthenticate({
		client,
		strategy: "phone",
		phoneNumber, // ex: +1234567890
	});
};

const handleLogin = async (phoneNumber: string, verificationCode: string) => {
	// verify phone number and connect
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "phone",
			phoneNumber,
			verificationCode,
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

### Authenticate via Passkey

<Callout variant="info" title="React Native support">

For React Native, `passkeyDomain` is required and must be set to a valid app universal link. To setup universal links for your application, follow the [iOS documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/supporting-associated-domains) and [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/identity/sign-in/credential-manager#add-support-dal).

</Callout>

```typescript
import { inAppWallet, hasStoredPasskey } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet({
			auth: {
				passkeyDomain: "example.com", // defaults to current url
			},
		});
		const hasPasskey = await hasStoredPasskey(client);
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "passkey",
			type: hasPasskey ? "sign-in" : "sign-up",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

### Authenticate with an external wallet

You can also use wallets as an authentication method, when using this method, both external and in-app wallets are connected, and you can switch between the 2 at any time.

```typescript
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "wallet",
			wallet: createWallet("io.metamask"), // or any other wallet
			chain: sepolia, // required for SIWE
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

### Authenticate as Guest

You can also create wallets for your users without any input at all. This will create a session that can be later upgraded by linking another identity. Great for progressive onboarding.

```typescript
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "guest",
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```


## Bring your own auth

From the in-app wallet settings on the thirdweb dashboard, you can enable [custom authentication with your own JWT or auth endpoint](/connect/in-app-wallet/custom-auth/configuration)

### OICD compliant JWT

Pass any OICD compliant JWT, can be used with firebase, auth0, and more.

```typescript
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "jwt",
			jwt: "your-jwt"
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```

### Custom Auth endpoint

Fully custom auth endpoint, pass your own payload and configure your auth verification endpoint on the thirdweb dashboard. This approach lets you use virtually any auth method you can imagine.

```typescript
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets/in-app";

const { connect } = useConnect();

const handleLogin = async () => {
	await connect(() => {
		const wallet = inAppWallet();
		await wallet.connect({
			client,
			strategy: "auth_endpoint",
			payload: "your-auth-payload"
		});
		return wallet;
	});
};
```
