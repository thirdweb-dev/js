# Read contract state

Read onchain data from any contract on any chain.

## Generic Contract Read

Reading contract state in react is done via the `useReadContract` hook. The hook returns a React Query `data`, `isLoading`, and other useful state that you can use to render your component.

```ts
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useReadContract } from "thirdweb/react";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const { data, isLoading } = useReadContract({
		contract,
		method: "function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) returns (string)",
		params: [1n],
	});
};
```

## Using Extensions

Extensions are a way to make complex queries from a contract in a type-safe way with a simple API.

```tsx
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useReadContract } from "thirdweb/react";
import { getOwnedNFTs } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const ownedNFTs = useReadContract(getOwnedNFTs, {
		contract,
		address: "0x...",
	});
};
```

Check out all the [available extensions](/references/typescript/v5/functions#extensions) for more details.

## Generic Contract Events

Query and listen to contract events with the `useContractEvents` hook.

```tsx
import { useContractEvents } from "thirdweb/react";
import { prepareEvent } from "thirdweb";

const myEvent = prepareEvent({
  signature: "event MyEvent(uint256 myArg)",
});

const { data: events } = useContractEvents({
    contract,
    eventName: [myEvent],
});
```

or with extensions:

```tsx
import { useContractEvents } from "thirdweb/react";
import { tokensClaimedEvent } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const { data: events } = useContractEvents({
    contract,
	events: [tokensClaimedEvent()]
});
```
