# Read contract state

Reading contract state in react is done via the `useReadContract` hook. The hook returns a React Query `data`, `isLoading`, and other useful state that you can use to render your component.

```ts
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useReadContract } from "thirdweb/react";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain,
	address: "0x...",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
	const { data, isLoading } = useReadContract({
		contract,
		method: "function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) returns (string)",
		params: [1n],
	});
};
```
