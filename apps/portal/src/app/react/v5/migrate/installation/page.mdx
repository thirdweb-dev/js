[Migrate from React v4](/react/v5/migrate)

# Installation & Setups

### High-level changes

- All imports from `@thirdweb-dev/*` should be replaced with `thirdweb` SDK with sub-exports.
- The new SDK is `function` based rather than `class` based for better tree shaking and performance.
- All contract calls are now prepared using `prepareContractCall` and sent using the `useSendTransaction` function.
- Transactions are submitted without waiting for receipt by default. You can call the `useSendAndConfirmTransaction` function to wait for the transaction to be mined.


## Installation

#### Below is how you install thirdweb v4 SDKs
<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/react ethers@5.7.2"
	yarn="yarn add @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/react ethers@5.7.2"
	pnpm="pnpm i @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/react ethers@5.7.2"
	bun="bun i @thirdweb-dev/sdk @thirdweb-dev/react ethers@5.7.2"
/>

#### With the latest version, everything comes in one single package
<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i thirdweb"
	yarn="yarn add thirdweb"
	pnpm="pnpm i thirdweb"
	bun="bun i thirdweb"
/>


## Setups

Once you have installed the latest package (alongside the older version that you want to replace), you can start the migration process.

### ThirdwebProvider

In the latest SDK, the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/references/typescript/v5/ThirdwebProvider) no longer accepts any prop such as `activeChain`, `clientId` or any extra SDK options.
Instead, you only need to pass the clientId when necessary (we'll talk more about this in a few sections below).

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react";

<ThirdwebProvider>  
 ...
</ThirdwebProvider>
```

###### Progressive migration


If you're currently using the `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`, you can progressively migrate to the new `thirdweb` SDK. Both SDKs can be used side by side and are interoperable with each other.

In React, you can mix and match the v4 and v5 `ThirdwebProvider`, that gives you access to the hooks and functionality of both SDKs.
This way, once you have moved away from all the v4 functionalities, you can finally remove the `ThirdwebProviderV4` from your app.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider as ThirdwebProviderV4 } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "thirdweb/react"; // v5

<ThirdwebProviderV4 activeChain={...} clientId={...}>
  <ThirdwebProvider>
     ...
  </ThirdwebProvider>
</ThirdwebProviderV4>
```

### Connecting wallets

Similar to v4's `ConnectWallet` component, the latest version has the [`ConnectButton`](/connect/sign-in/ConnectButton) component which has the same functionality.

However, unlike with v4 where the number of supported wallets is limited (about 20), and adding more wallets mean your app becomes heavier,
the SDK v5 supports [over 300 wallets](/typescript/v5/supported-wallets) with virtually no impact to your application. 

Here's how you use the new `ConnectButton`:

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TW_CLIENT_ID,
});

<ConnectButton client={client} />
```

To learn more about the new `ConnectButton`, head over to the [Playground](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard/connect/playground).

Notice how you are passing the thirdweb client to the component itself and not to the `ThirdwebProvider` like in v4?
By not putting every config inside the context wrapper, we were able to make the SDK v5 much more lightweight since you only load what you need!


Tip: You can reuse the thirdweb client object by putting it in a file and export it.
```ts
// @lib/client.ts

import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

export const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TW_CLIENT_ID,
});

```
