[Migrate from React v4](/react/v5/migrate)

# Interacting with contracts

With SDK v4, you always have to "load" a contract with `useContract`. This process adds complexity to your app and inpacts its performance.  
In the latest version, a smart contract (type: [`ThirdwebContract`](/references/typescript/v5/ThirdwebContract)) represents a simple object containing info about the contract address, the chain it was deployed on, and the thirdweb client object.

Example for declaring a smart contract on Ethereum mainnet
```tsx
import { getContract, createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ethereum } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
  clientId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TW_CLIENT_ID,
});

const contract = getContract({
  address: "0x....",
  chain: ethereum,
  client,
});
```

## Contract extensions

This is a new terminology that we introduced in the new SDK. Basically, each extension represents a method of a contract, be it a "write" or a "read" method.

An extension is a function that returns a [`PreparedTransaction`](/references/typescript/v5/PreparedTransaction) which in turn can be executed in a React hook for interacting with the contract. We will talk more about it in the section below.

One of the amazing updates that v5 brings is the rich set of prebuilt extensions. They are the contract methods that have been precompile to ensure a typesafe & performant developer experience.

Check out the list of over 100 prebuilt extensions [here](/typescript/v5/extensions/built-in), ranging from ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 to top popular DeFi protocols like Uniswap, Farcaster & Lens.

Example: Import an ERC1155 "read" extension, for checking the balance of a wallet
```tsx
import { balanceOf } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc1155";

const transaction = balanceOf({
  contract,
  owner: "0x...",
  tokenId: 0n,
});
```

## Reading states of a contract
Given the task of calling `balanceOf` from an ERC1155 contract, we'll be comparing the code between v4 and v5

#### SDK v4
```tsx
import { useNFTBalance, useContract } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const { isLoading, data, error } = useNFTBalance(
    contract,
    "{{wallet_address}}",
    "{{token_id}}",
  );
}

```

#### SDK v5
```tsx
import { getContract, createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { balanceOf } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc1155";
import { ethereum } from "thirdweb/chains";
import { client } from "@lib/client";

const contract = getContract({
  address: "0x....",
  chain: ethereum,
  client,
});

function App() {
  const { data } = useReadContract(balanceOf, { contract, owner: "0x...", tokenId: 0n });
}
```

As you can see from the example above, we introduced the hook [`useReadContract`](/references/typescript/v5/useReadContract) in v5.
You should use it to perform any contract "read" in your React app.
It is the perfect replacement for the old chunky React hooks from v4. 

The formula for reading a contract state is:
```
useReadContract + <the read contract method>
```

#### If the extension you are looking for is not included in the SDK
You can always use the function signature with `useReadContract` (It's also typesafe)
```tsx
useReadContract({
  contract,
  method: "function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 tokenId) view returns (uint256)",
  ...
})
```

#### A tip for getting a function's signature
Go to the thirdweb Dashboard's explorer page and select the function that you want to interact with.
You should see the "Use this function in your app" section with the code snippet for the signature of the function.

[An example](https://thirdweb.com/avalanche-fuji/0xd5e815241882676F772A624E3892b27Ff3a449c4/explorer?name=balanceOf)


## Writing to a contract
In v5, you can utilize the following hooks for writing to contracts: [`useSendTransaction`](/references/typescript/v5/useSendTransaction) and [`useSendAndConfirmTransaction`](/references/typescript/v5/useSendAndConfirmTransaction).
The main difference between the 2 hooks is that `useSendTransaction` will mark the request as "complete" once the transaction is sent,
while `useSendAndConfirmTransaction` will wait until the transaction is included in the blockchain.

Given the task of claiming an NFT from an NFT Drop collection, let's compare the code between the SDK v4 and v5


#### SDK V4
```tsx
import { useContract, useClaimNFT } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
  const { contract } = useContract(contractAddress);
  const {
    mutateAsync: claimNft,
    isLoading,
    error,
  } = useClaimNFT(contract);

  return (
    <Web3Button
      contractAddress={contractAddress}
      action={() =>
        claimNft({
          to: "{{wallet_address}}", // Use useAddress hook to get current wallet address
          quantity: 1,
        })
      }
    >
      Claim NFT
    </Web3Button>
  );
}
```

#### SDK v5
```tsx
import { useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";
import { claimTo } from "thirdweb/extension/erc721";

function App() {
  const transaction = claimTo({ contract, quantity: 1n, to: "0x..." });
  const { mutateAsync: claimNft } = useSendTransaction();

  return <button onClick={() => claimNft(transaction)}>
    Claim
  </button>
}
```

Another beautiful thing about the SDK v5 is that it comes with the [`TransactionButton`](/references/typescript/v5/TransactionButton) 
which allows you to make a contract call _without_ having to use the above React hooks. As you can see, the code is much cleaner this way!

```tsx
import { TransactionButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { claimTo } from "thirdweb/extension/erc721";

function App() {
  return <TransactionButton transaction={
    () => claimTo({ contract, quantity: 1n, to: "0x..." })
  }>
    Claim
  </TransactionButton>
}
```
