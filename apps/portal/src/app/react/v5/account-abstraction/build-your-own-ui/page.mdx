# Build your own UI

You can also use the connection hooks and functions to connect to your smart accounts and build your fully custom UI.

<Step title="Get a free API key">

You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services such as the bundler and paymaster.

Obtain an API key from the [thirdweb dashboard Settings page](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

The API key lets you access thirdweb's bundler and paymaster infrastructure, which is required for smart accounts to operate and optionally enable [gasless transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions).

Learn more about creating an API key and restricting which contracts the smart account can interact with [here](/api-keys).

</Step>
<Step title="Connect smart accounts in your application">

Using `useConnect`, you can pass the `accountAbstraction` prop to automatically convert any connected wallet to a smart account.

The connected wallet will be the admin wallet of the smart account.

<Callout title="Sponsored transactions" variant="info">

To set up sponsored transactions, set the `sponsorGas` option to `true` in the smart account configuration.
All transactions performed with the smart account will then be sponsored by your application. Testnet transactions are free, but you need a valid credit card on file for mainnet transactions.

</Callout>

```tsx
import { useConnect } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

function App() {
	// 1. set the `accountAbstraction` configuration
	const { connect } = useConnect({
		client,
		accountAbstraction: {
			chain: sepolia, // the chain where your smart accounts will be or is deployed
			sponsorGas: true, // enable or disable sponsored transactions
		},
	});

	const connectToSmartAccount = async () => {
		// 2. connect with the admin wallet of the smart account
		connect(async () => {
			const wallet = inAppWallet(); // or any other wallet
			await wallet.connect({
				client,
				chain: sepolia,
				strategy: "google",
			});
			return wallet;
		});
	};

	return <button onClick={() => connectToSmartAccount()}>Connect</button>;
}
```

</Step>
<Step title="Executing Transactions with Smart Accounts">

Once setup, you can use the Connect [TypeScript](/typescript/v5), [React](/react/v5), or [React Native](/react-native/v5) SDKs to deploy contracts, perform transactions, and manipulate smart accounts like any other wallet.

```tsx
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useActiveAccount, useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";
import { claimTo, balanceOf } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const contract = getContract({ client, chain, address: "0x..." });

// The ThirdwebProvider setup above already handles the connection to the smart account
// Within the provider, you can use the SDK normally to interact with the blockchain
export default function MyComponent() {
	// Get the connected smart account
	const smartAccount = useActiveAccount();
	// Example read
	const { data, isLoading } = useReadContract(
		balanceOf,
		{
			contract,
			owner: smartAccount.address,
		},
		{
			enabled: !!smartAccount,
		},
	);
	// Example write
	const { mutate: sendTransaction, isPending } = useSendTransaction();
	const mint = () => {
		sendTransaction({
			transaction: claimTo({
				contract,
				to: smartAccount.address,
				quantity: 1n,
			}),
		});
	};
	// Mint a new NFT
	return <button onClick={mint}>Mint NFT</button>;
}
```
