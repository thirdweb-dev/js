# Getting Started

Getting started to add ERC-4337 compatible smart accounts to your application easily.

Once set, your application will:

- Let users **connect to their smart account** using any personal wallet, including in-app wallets for easy onboarding.
- Automatically **deploy individual account contracts** for your users when they do their first onchain transaction.
- **Handle all transaction gas costs** via the thirdweb paymaster.

<Steps>
<Step title="Get a free API key">

You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services such as the bundler and paymaster.

Obtain an API key from the [thirdweb dashboard Settings page](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

The API key lets you access thirdweb's bundler and paymaster infrastructure, which is required for smart accounts to operate and optionally enable [gasless transactions](/glossary/gasless-transactions).

Learn more about creating an API key and restricting which contracts the smart account can interact with [here](/api-keys).

</Step>
<Step title="Connect smart accounts in your application">

The easiest way to get started with account abstraction is to use the [ConnectButton](/connect/sign-in/ConnectButton) component. Simply add the `accountAbstraction` property with the desired chain and whether to sponsor gas for your users.

With this property, all connected wallets will be automatically converted to smart accounts. The connected wallet will be the admin wallet of the smart account.

<Callout title="Sponsored transactions" variant="info">

To set up sponsored transactions, set the `sponsorGas` option to `true` in the smart account configuration.
All transactions performed with the smart account will then be sponsored by your application. Testnet transactions are free, but you need a valid credit card on file for mainnet transactions.

</Callout>

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
clientId: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
});

export default function App() {
return (
    <ThirdwebProvider>
      <ConnectButton
	    client={client}
	    accountAbstraction={{
			chain: sepolia, // the chain where your smart accounts will be or is deployed
            sponsorGas: true // enable or disable sponsored transactions
        }}
	  />
    </ThirdwebProvider>
  );
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Executing Transactions with Smart Accounts">

Once setup, you can use the rest of the Connect [React SDK](/react/latest) to deploy contracts, perform transactions, and manipulate smart accounts like any other wallet.

```tsx
import { getContract } from "thirdweb";
import { useActiveAccount, TransactionButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { claimTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const contract = getContract({ client, chain, address: "0x..." });

// The ThirdwebProvider setup above already handles the connection to the smart account
// Within the provider, you can use the SDK normally to interact with the blockchain
export default function MyComponent() {
	// Get the connected smart account
	const smartAccount = useActiveAccount();
	// Mint a new NFT
	return (
		<TransactionButton
			transaction={() => {
				if (!account) return;
				return claimTo({
					contract,
					to: account.address,
					quantity: 1n,
				});
			}}
		>
			Mint NFT
		</TransactionButton>
	);
}
```

</Step>
</Steps>

### Build your own UI

You can also use the connection hooks and functions to connect to your smart accounts and build your fully custom UI.

See the [Build your own UI](/react/v5/account-abstraction/build-your-own-ui) guide for more information.
