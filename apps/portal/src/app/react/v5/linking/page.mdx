# Link Profiles

When using [in-app wallets](/react/v5/in-app-wallet/get-started) or [ecosystem wallets](/react/v5/ecosystem-wallets/get-started), you can link profiles to your account. This allows users to login with a frictionless method like guest, passkey or email, then later link their wallet or social profile to their account.

Once linked, users can login to their account with any of their linked profiles.

## Live Playground

Try out the demo for yourself in the [link profiles live playground](https://playground.thirdweb.com/connect/in-app-wallet)

<Stack>

<ArticleIconCard
	title="Try the demo"
	icon={ExternalLink}
	href="https://playground.thirdweb.com/connect/in-app-wallet"
	description="See the SDK in action on the live playground"
/>
</Stack>

## Available auth methods

<AuthList />

## Usage with UI Components

When using [`ConnectButton`](/references/typescript/v5/ConnectButton) or [`useWalletDetailsModal`](/references/typescript/v5/useWalletDetailsModal), users can link a new profile by clicking the "Manage Wallet" button, as long as they are connected with an in-app or ecosystem wallet.

## Usage with your own UI

You can use the [`useLinkProfile`](/references/typescript/v5/useLinkProfile) function to link a new profile to your account. This can be useful if you want to use a custom UI for the linking flow.

<Stack>

<ArticleIconCard
	title="useLinkProfile"
	icon={ReactIcon}
	href="/references/typescript/v5/useLinkProfile"
	description="Hook to link a new profile to your account"
/>
</Stack>
