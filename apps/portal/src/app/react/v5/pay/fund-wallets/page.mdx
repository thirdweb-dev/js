## Usage with UI Components

The easiest way to fund wallets is to use the `PayEmbed` prebuilt UI component. Note that the `ConnectButton` also has a built-in funding flow that can also be customised.

```tsx
import { PayEmbed } from "thirdweb/react";

function App() {
  return (
    <PayEmbed
      client={client}
      payOptions={{
        mode: "fund_wallet",
        metadata: {
          name: "Get funds",
        },
        prefillBuy: {
          chain: base,
          amount: "0.01",
        },
        // ... theme, currency, amounts, payment methods, etc.
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

Check out the [PayEmbed API reference](/references/typescript/v5/PayEmbed) for more information.

## Usage with your own UI

If you want more control over the funding flow, you can use the [Buy with Crypto or Fiat hooks](/references/typescript/v5/hooks#buy-crypto) to create your own custom UI.
