# Chain Abstraction

Facilitate transactions by letting users pay with any token from any chain, or with fiat.

## Usage with regular transactions

Any transaction sent with `useSendTransaction` or with `TransactionButton` will prompt the user to choose a different payment method if they don't have enough balance for the transaction.

You can turn off this behaviour by setting the `payModal` option to `false`.
