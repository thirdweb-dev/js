# Chain Abstraction

Facilitate transactions by letting users pay with any token from any chain, or with fiat.

## Usage with PayEmbed

You can use the `PayEmbed` component to let users execute a transaction from any chain, paying with any token.

```tsx
import { claimTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc1155";
import { PayEmbed, useActiveAccount } from "thirdweb/react";

function App() {
  const account = useActiveAccount();
  const { data: nft } = useReadContract(getNFT, {
    contract: nftContract,
    tokenId: 0n,
  });

  return (
    <PayEmbed
      client={client}
      payOptions={{
        mode: "transaction",
        transaction: claimTo({
          contract: nftContract,
          quantity: 1n,
          tokenId: 0n,
          to: account?.address,
        }),
        metadata: nft?.metadata,
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Usage with regular transactions

Any transaction sent with `useSendTransaction` or with `TransactionButton` will prompt the user to choose a different payment method if they don't have enough balance for the transaction.

You can turn off this behaviour by setting the `payModal` option to `false`.
