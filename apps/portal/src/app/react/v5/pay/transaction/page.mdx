# Chain Abstraction

Facilitate transactions by letting users pay with any token from any chain, or with fiat.

## Usage with regular transactions

Any transaction sent with `useSendTransaction` or with `TransactionButton` will prompt the user to choose a different payment method if they don't have enough balance for the transaction.

You can turn off this behaviour by setting the `payModal` option to `false`.

## Usage with TransactionWidget

The `TransactionWidget` component provides a complete UI for executing transactions with built-in cross-chain payment support.

```tsx
import { TransactionWidget } from "thirdweb/react";
import { prepareContractCall } from "thirdweb";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <TransactionWidget
      client={client}
      transaction={prepareContractCall({
        contract: myContract,
        method: "function mint(uint256 quantity)",
        params: [1n],
      })}
      amount="0.1"
      title="Mint NFT"
    />
  );
}
```
