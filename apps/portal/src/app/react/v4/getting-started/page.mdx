# Getting Started

You can get started by creating a new project or adding thirdweb to an existing project.

## Existing Projects

Install the thirdweb packages in your project

<InstallTabs
	npm="npm i @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers@^5"
	yarn="yarn add @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers@^5"
	pnpm="pnpm i @thirdweb-dev/react @thirdweb-dev/sdk ethers@^5"
/>

And follow the framework specific instructions below.

<Details summary="Vite" id='vite'>

1. Install the vite plugins

   <InstallTabs
   	npm="npm i @vitejs/plugin-react vite-plugin-node-polyfills -D"
   	yarn="yarn add @vitejs/plugin-react vite-plugin-node-polyfills -D"
   	pnpm="pnpm add @vitejs/plugin-react vite-plugin-node-polyfills -D"
   />

2. In the `vite.config.js` file, add the following configuration:

   ```js
   import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
   import { defineConfig } from "vite";
   import { nodePolyfills } from "vite-plugin-node-polyfills";

   export default defineConfig({
   	plugins: [react(), nodePolyfills()],
   	define: {
   		"process.env": {},
   	},
   });
   ```

</Details>

### Pages Router

No additional configuration is required if you are using the [pages router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages)

### App Router

If you are using the new [app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), and If you import a component such as `ThirdwebProvider` in a server component, Next.js will throw an error saying that the component is not marked with `"use client"` directive.

You will need to create an alias for that component in a separate file with `"use client"` directive on top (before all the imports) and import that instead of using the component directly from `@thirdweb-dev/react` in server components.

#### Example

```tsx
"use client";

export { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// app/components/ThirdwebProvider.tsx
```

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "./components/ThirdwebProvider";

export default function Home() {
	return <ThirdwebProvider> ... </ThirdwebProvider>;
}

// app/page.tsx
```

</Details>

<Details summary="Create React App" id='create-react-app'>

1. Add below packages as dependencies in your package.json

   ```json
   {
     ...
     "dependencies": {
       ...
       "url": "latest",
       "http": "npm:http-browserify",
       "https": "npm:https-browserify",
       "zlib": "npm:browserify-zlib",
       "http-browserify": "latest",
       "https-browserify": "latest",
       "browserify-zlib": "latest",
       "assert": "^2.0.0",
       "stream": "^0.0.2"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Install them from NPM using the following command

   <InstallTabs npm="npm install" yarn="yarn" pnpm="pnpm install" />

To ignore the sourcemap warnings, create a `.env` file with the following in your root directory:

```text
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

</Details>

## New Projects

Create a new project using the thirdweb CLI

```bash
npx thirdweb create app
```

<Callout variant="info" title='API Key'>

You will require an API key to use thirdweb's infrastructure services with the SDK. If you haven't created a key yet you can do so for **free** from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

</Callout>

## Wrap your application in ThirdwebProvider

Wrap your application in the [`ThirdwebProvider`](/react/v4/ThirdwebProvider) component to start using the SDK.

```jsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const App = () => {
	return (
		<ThirdwebProvider activeChain="ethereum" clientId="your-client-id">
			<YourApp />
		</ThirdwebProvider>
	);
};
```

With the provider set up, all of the SDK&rsquo;s hooks and components work out of the box!

Now you can connect to the user&rsquo;s wallet and start calling functions on your smart contracts like so:

```jsx
import { Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const Home = () => {
	return (
		<Web3Button
			contractAddress="{{contract_address}}"
			action={async (contract) => contract.call("myFunctionName")}
		>
			Call myFunctionName from the connected wallet
		</Web3Button>
	);
};
```
