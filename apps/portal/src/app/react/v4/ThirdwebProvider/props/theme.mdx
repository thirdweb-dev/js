Sets the theme for all thirdweb components.

By default it is set to `"dark"`

theme can be set to either `"dark"` or `"light"` or a custom [`Theme`](/references/react/v4/Theme) object.

You can also import the [`lightTheme`](/references/react/v4/lightTheme) or [`darkTheme`](/references/react/v4/lightTheme) functions from `@thirdweb-dev/react` to use the default themes as base and overrides parts of it.

### Using default themes

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

<ThirdwebProvider theme="light">
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

### Overriding theme

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, lightTheme } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const customTheme = lightTheme({
	colors: {
		modalBg: "red",
	},
});

<ThirdwebProvider theme={customTheme}>
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```
