locale object contains text used for all thirdweb components

it allows you to change the language used in UI components or override the texts used in the UI

React SDK comes out of the box with Spanish and Japanese locale functions, but you can add support for any language you want just by passing an object with the required strings

### Using Built-in Locales

#### Using English locale ( default )

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, en } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const english = en();

<ThirdwebProvider locale={english}>
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

#### Using the Spanish locale

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, es } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const spanish = es();

<ThirdwebProvider locale={spanish}>
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

#### Using the Japanese locale

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, jp } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const japanese = jp();

<ThirdwebProvider locale={japanese}>
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

#### Overriding the locale

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, en } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

// override some texts
const english = en({
	connectWallet: {
		confirmInWallet: "Confirm in your wallet",
	},
	wallets: {
		metamaskWallet: {
			connectionScreen: {
				inProgress: "Awaiting Confirmation",
				instruction: "Accept connection request in your MetaMask wallet",
			},
		},
	},
});

<ThirdwebProvider locale={english}>
	<App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```

### Custom locale object

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

<ThirdwebProvider locale={{ .... }}>
  <App />
</ThirdwebProvider>;
```
