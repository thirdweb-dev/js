Option to disable the button.

By default, the button is disabled and shows a spinner icon while the transaction is executing.

```jsx
import { Web3Button } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

function App() {
	return (
		<Web3Button
			contractAddress="0x..."
			action={(contract) => console.log(contract)} // Logic to execute when clicked
			isDisabled
		>
			Execute Action
		</Web3Button>
	);
}
```
