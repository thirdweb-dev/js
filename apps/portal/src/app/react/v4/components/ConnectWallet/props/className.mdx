This class is applied to the ConnectWallet button ( not the modal ). Using this className, you can further customize the button's styles using custom CSS.

For some CSS properties, you may need to use the [`!important`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#the_!important_exception)
to override the default styles

```jsx
<ConnectWallet className="my-custom-class" />
```
