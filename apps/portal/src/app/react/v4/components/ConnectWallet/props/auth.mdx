Enforce that users must sign in with their wallet using [auth](/connect/auth) after connecting their wallet.

Requires the [`authConfig`](/react/v4/ThirdwebProvider#authConfig) prop to be set on the [`ThirdWebProvider`](/react/v4/ThirdwebProvider) component.

```jsx
<ConnectWallet
	auth={{
		loginOptional: false,
		onLogin(token) {
			console.log("user logged in", token);
		},
		onLogout() {
			console.log("user logged out");
		},
	}}
/>
```
