Set the theme to either `"light"` or `"dark"` or pass a custom theme object to completely customize the look and feel of the ConnectWallet Modal.

The default is `"dark"`

```jsx
<ConnectWallet theme="dark" />
```

#### Create a custom theme

Instead of passing an object along with all the required colors, you can use the `darkTheme` or `lightTheme` functions to use light / dark theme as base and override just the parts you want to change.

```tsx
import { darkTheme, lightTheme } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const customDarkTheme = darkTheme({
	fontFamily: "Inter, sans-serif",
	colors: {
		modalBg: "#000000",
		accentText: "red",
		// ... etc
	},
});

<ConnectWallet theme={customDarkTheme} />;
```
