The `clientId` prop is required to use the thirdweb infrastructure services with the SDK. You can get a client ID by creating an API key on [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

```jsx
function MyApp() {
	return (
		<ThirdwebSDKProvider activeChain={"ethereum"} clientId="your-client-id">
			<App />
		</ThirdwebSDKProvider>
	);
}
```
