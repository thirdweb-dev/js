# Connecting Wallets

There are two ways you connect user's wallet to your application using thirdweb's React SDK

1. Using the [`ConnectWallet`](/react/v4/components/ConnectWallet) or [`ConnectEmbed`](/react/v4/components/ConnectEmbed) component for a quick, easy and customizable UI
2. Create a completely custom UI using [wallet connection hooks](/react/v4/connecting-wallets/custom-ui)

<ArticleIconCard
	href="/react/v4/wallets"
	title="Supported Wallets"
	icon={Wallet2Icon}
/>
