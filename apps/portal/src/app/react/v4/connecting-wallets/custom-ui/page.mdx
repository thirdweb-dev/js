# Custom UI for connecting wallet

Connecting a wallet involves a few steps:

1. Create a wallet instance
2. Call the `connect` method on the wallet instance
3. Set the connected wallet instance as "connected wallet" in thidweb's React SDK

## Simple method

If you just want to connect a wallet as mentioned above - there's a simple way to do it using the [useConnect](/references/react/v4/useConnect) hook which does all the above steps for you.

```tsx
import {
	useConnect,
	// import the wallet you want to connect
	metamaskWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const walletConfig = metamaskWallet();

function Example() {
	const connect = useConnect();

	async function handleConnect() {
		try {
			const wallet = await connect(
				walletConfig, // pass the wallet config object
				connectOptions, // pass options required by the wallet (if any)
			);

			console.log("connected to", wallet);
		} catch (e) {
			console.error("failed to connect", e);
		}
	}

	return <button onClick={handleConnect}> connect wallet </button>;
}
```

## Advanced method

But if you need to create wallet instance and call some methods on the wallet instance before connecting the wallet,
you can do these steps manually as shown below using the [useCreateWalletInstance](/references/react/v4/useCreateWalletInstance), [useSetConnectionStatus](/references/react/v4/useSetConnectionStatus) and [useSetConnectedWallet](/references/react/v4/useSetConnectedWallet) hooks.

There are 3 steps to connect your wallet manually:

- create an instance of your wallet using `useCreateWalletInstance`
- connect your wallet using the `connect` method of the wallet
- once the wallet is connected, set the wallet instance as connected using `useSetConnectedWallet`

Make sure to update the `connectionStatus` using `useSetConnectionStatus` to `"connecting"` before connecting your wallet and `"disconnected"` if the connection fails.

### Example

We will use [`localWallet`](/references/react/v4/localWallet) as an example because it can not be connected using the `useConnect` hook because it requires additional steps after creating the wallet instance - like generating a random wallet or importing a wallet. We will generate a random wallet in this example.

```tsx
import {
	useCreateWalletInstance,
	useSetConnectionStatus,
	useSetConnectedWallet,
	// import the wallet you want to connect
	localWallet,
} from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

const walletConfig = localWallet();

function Example() {
	const createWalletInstance = useCreateWalletInstance();
	const setConnectionStatus = useSetConnectionStatus();
	const setConnectedWallet = useSetConnectedWallet();

	const handleConnect = async () => {
		// 1. create wallet instance
		const wallet = createWalletInstance(walletConfig);

		// perform additional steps that needs to be done before connecting the wallet
		// here, we will generate a random wallet
		await wallet.generate();

		try {
			setConnectionStatus("connecting");

			// 2. Call `connect` method on wallet instance
			await wallet.connect(
				connectOptions, // pass options required by the wallet (if any)
			);

			// 3. Set wallet instance as the connected wallet
			setConnectedWallet(wallet);
		} catch (e) {
			setConnectionStatus("disconnected");
			console.error("failed to connect", e);
			// show error UI or close modal using props.close()
		}
	};

	return <button onClick={handleConnect}> connect wallet </button>;
}
```

## Useful hooks to build custom UI

Once the wallet is connected, you can use React SDK's [100+ hooks](/references/react/v4/hooks) to show connected wallet's Details, send transactions, interact with smart contracts, sign messages and utilize common standards such as tokens, NFTs, marketplaces; all with built-in caching, [RPC URLs](/glossary/rpc), [IPFS gateways](/glossary/ipfs), and more!

Here is a list of few hooks that will be useful when creating custom UI

| Hook                                                            | Description                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| [useAddress](/references/react/v4/useAddress)                   | get connected wallet's account address |
| [useDisconnect](/references/react/v4/useDisconnect)             | disconnect the connected wallet        |
| [useWallet](/references/react/v4/useWallet)                     | get connected wallet instance          |
| [useWalletConfig](/references/react/v4/useWalletConfig)         | get connected wallet's config          |
| [useConnectionStatus](/references/react/v4/useConnectionStatus) | get status of wallet connection        |
| [useSigner](/references/react/v4/useSigner)                     | get signer of connected wallet         |
