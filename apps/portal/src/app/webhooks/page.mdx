# Webhooks

Webhooks are a way to receive real-time updates for onchain and offchain events.

An **event** is a real-time update or action that occured for your team or project.

A **webhook** is a configured endpoint on your backend that receives events.

A **topic** is an identifier that groups events (example: `engine.transaction.sent`).
- The thirdweb product ("engine")
- The object ("engine.transaction")
- The event that occurred ("sent")

Each webhook can subscribe to multiple topics.

## Quickstart

1. Configure an HTTP endpoint on your backend to receive events.
1. Create a webhook in the thirdweb dashboard to subscribe to topics.
1. (Recommended) Verify the webhook signature to secure your endpoint.

## Manage your webhooks

Manage your webhooks from the thirdweb dashboard.

1. Select your team and project.
1. Select **Webhooks** in the left sidebar.

### Create a webhook

Select **Create Webhook** to create a new webhook.

Provide the following details:
- Description: A name for your webhook.
- Destination URL: The URL to send the webhook to. Only HTTPS URLs are supported.
- Topics: The thirdweb topics to subscribe this webhook to.
- Start Paused: Whether the webhook should immediately start receiving events.

### Update or delete a webhook

Find your webhook in the list.
- Select **... > Edit** to update your webhook details or subscribed topics.
- Select **... > Delete** to delete it.

### View analytics

Monitor your webhooks' requests over time to identify errors or latency issues.

## Retries

Webhook delivery attempts only consider a **2xx status code** returned within the **10-second timeout** as successful.

Otherwise the delivery will retry multiple times over the next 24 hours with exponential backoff.

### Automatic suspension of failing webhooks

Webhooks experiencing high error rates (non-2xx status codes) sustained over several hours will be paused automatically.
A paused webhook cannot receive any webhook events until it is manually resumed from the dashboard.

You will be notified via email and a dashboard notification when your webhook is paused.

## Handle webhook events

Your HTTP endpoint should handle webhook events and return a 200 status code quickly. Avoid slow or long-running synchronous operations, or move them to a queue in your backend.

### HTTP format

Webhooks are sent as a `POST` request to your configured endpoint.

**Headers**

- `content-type`: `application/json`
- `x-webhook-id`: A unique identifier for this webhook
- `x-webhook-signature`: HMAC-SHA256 signature
  - See *Verify webhook signature* below
- `x-webhook-timestamp`: Timestamp of delivery attempt in Unix seconds
  - See *Reject expired webhooks* below

**Request body**

```json
{
  "id": "evt_cllcqqie908ii4q0ugld6noeu",
  "type": "engine.transaction.sent",
  "triggered_at": 1752471197,
  "object": "engine.transaction",
  "data": {
    // ...engine.transaction fields
  },
}
```

- `id`: A unique identifier for the event for this topic. Multiple delivery attempts for the same event will use the same ID.
- `type`: The topic that an event was triggered for.
- `triggered_at`: The timestamp the event was triggered in Unix seconds.
  - Note: This value does not change for each delivery attempt, but the `x-webhook-timestamp` header does.
- `object`: The object that defines the shape of `data`.
- `data`: The object payload for the event.

### Secure your webhook endpoint

The `x-webhook-signature` header is a signature that hashes the raw request body and the delivery timestamp.
This signature ensures that neither the request body nor the timestamp were modified and can be trusted as sent from thirdweb.

Follow these steps to verify the webhook signature:
1. Concatenate `{TIMESTAMP_IN_UNIX_SECONDS}.{REQUEST_JSON_BODY}`.
1. Hash the result with the webhook secret using SHA256.
1. Compare the result with the `x-webhook-signature` header.

**Code examples**

<Details summary="Verify webhook signature in TypeScript"> 
```typescript
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from "crypto";

const webhookSecret = "whsecret_..."; // Your webhook secret from the dashboard
const actualSignature = req.headers["x-webhook-signature"];
const timestamp = req.headers["x-webhook-timestamp"];
const body = "..." // raw HTTP body as string

// Generate the expected signature.
const expectedSignature = createHmac("sha256", webhookSecret)
  .update(`${timestamp}.${body}`)
  .digest("hex");

// Use `timingSafeEqual` to compare the signatures safely.
const expected = Buffer.from(expectedSignature, "hex");
const actual = Buffer.from(actualSignature, "hex");
const isValidSignature =
  expected.length === actual.length &&
  timingSafeEqual(expected, actual);

if (!isValidSignature) {
  throw new Error("Invalid webhook signature");
}
```
</Details>

### Reject expired webhooks (optional)

You can reject webhook attempts that are received after a certain duration. This prevents requests from being replayed.

```typescript
const MAX_AGE_SECONDS = 10 * 60 * 1000; // 10 minutes
const timestamp = req.headers["x-webhook-timestamp"];
if (Date.now() / 1000 - timestamp > MAX_AGE_SECONDS) {
  throw new Error("Webhook expired");
}
```
