# ThirdwebRuntimeSettings

This file defines the `UThirdwebRuntimeSettings` class, which provides configuration settings for the Thirdweb SDK within Unreal Engine. These settings are used by the SDK to manage essential information like client credentials and storage paths.

## Key Components

### `UThirdwebRuntimeSettings`
- A class derived from `UDeveloperSettings`, responsible for storing and managing Thirdweb SDK configuration settings.
- **Properties**:
  - `ClientID`: The client ID used to authenticate with Thirdweb services.
  - `BundleID`: The bundle ID associated with the application.
  - `SecretKey`: A secret key used for secure interactions with Thirdweb.
  - `StorageDirectoryPath`: The path where the SDK's data should be stored.

### Configuration Requirements
- Only `ClientID` and `BundleID` **or** `SecretKey` are required for authentication with Thirdweb services.
- The `StorageDirectoryPath` can be left blank if no specific storage location is needed.

### Core Function

- **`Get()`**:
  - Static function to retrieve the current `UThirdwebRuntimeSettings` instance.
  - **Returns**: A pointer to the `UThirdwebRuntimeSettings` instance.

## Internal Implementation Notes

- The settings defined in this class are used internally by the `UThirdwebSubsystem` to interact with the Thirdweb services.
- **Private Methods**:
  - `GetClientID()`: Retrieves the client ID as a C-string.
  - `GetBundleID()`: Retrieves the bundle ID as a C-string.
  - `GetSecretKey()`: Retrieves the secret key as a C-string.
  - `GetStorageDirectoryPath()`: Retrieves the storage directory path as a C-string.
