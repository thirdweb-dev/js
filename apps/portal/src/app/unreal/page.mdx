# Unreal SDK

A Code Plugin for Unreal Engine that enables developers to create thirdweb Private Key Wallets, In-App Wallets and Smart Wallets for their games and applications. The plugin provides a simple API and blueprints to interact with wallets, login with email or socials as well as create Smart Wallet session keys. 

With this plugin, you can keep the onboarding of your users in-client and grant a session key to your [thirdweb Engine](https://portal.thirdweb.com/engine) powered backend to interact with the blockchain, no signature in sight.

The Thirdweb Unreal Plugin is distributed as an [Unreal Marketplace Code Plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/f21200c2610146f3888172994448e50d).
