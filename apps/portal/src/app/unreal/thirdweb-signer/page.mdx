# ThirdwebSigner

This file defines the `FSigner` struct, which represents a signer in the context of a smart wallet within the Thirdweb SDK. The signer is responsible for signing transactions and managing the approval of targets and limits on native tokens.

## Key Components

### `FSigner`
- A struct representing a signer associated with a smart wallet.
- **Properties**:
  - `Address`: The Ethereum address of the signer.
  - `ApprovedTargets`: An array of approved contract addresses that the signer is allowed to interact with.
  - `NativeTokenLimitPerTransaction`: The limit on the amount of native tokens (e.g., ETH) that can be spent per transaction.
  - `StartTime`: The start time for the signer's permissions, specified as a `FDateTime`.
  - `EndTime`: The end time for the signer's permissions, specified as a `FDateTime`.

### Core Function

- **`FromJson(const TSharedPtr<FJsonObject>& JsonObject)`**:
  - Static function to create an `FSigner` instance from a JSON object.
  - **Parameters**:
    - `JsonObject`: The JSON object containing the signer's data.
  - **Returns**: An `FSigner` instance populated with the data from the JSON object.

## Internal Implementation Notes

- The `FSigner` struct is used internally by the Thirdweb SDK to represent a signer with specific permissions and limits within a smart wallet. It leverages Unreal Engine's `FDateTime` for handling time-based permissions and uses JSON parsing to populate the signer data.
