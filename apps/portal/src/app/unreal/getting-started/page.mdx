# Getting Started

<Callout variant='info' title="API Key Required">

To get started with the Unreal SDK, you will need to have a [thirdweb API Key](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key) created. Make sure you allowlist a bundle ID to use within Unreal native applications.

</Callout>

## Integration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Plugin Download" >

Download and install the Thirdweb Unreal Plugin from the [Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/f21200c2610146f3888172994448e50d).

</Step>

<Step title="Runtime Settings" >

Once you import the plugin into your project, you will need to set up the plugin settings with your Client ID and Bundle ID.

You can do so by navigating to `Edit > Project Settings > Engine > Thirdweb` and filling in the required fields. 

<DocImage src={unrealSettings} className="w-[800px]" />

Alternatively, you can head to your root `Config` folder and open the `DefaultEngine.ini` file to set up the plugin settings.

```ini
[/Script/Thirdweb.ThirdwebRuntimeSettings]
ClientID=
BundleID=
SecretKey=
StorageDirectoryPath=
```

Note that a Secret Key should not be used in client applications, as it is a sensitive piece of information. The Storage Directory Path is also optional and can be left empty.

</Step>

<Step title="Test it!" >

Try out our prebuilt example `Level_Thirdweb` to create and login to wallets seamlessly, using all kinds of authentication, and explore advanced Account Abstraction use cases.
