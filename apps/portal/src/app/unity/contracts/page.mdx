# Interacting with Contracts

The Unity SDK provides different ways for you to interact with smart contract functionality:

1. Generic reading data _from_ and writing transactions _to_ smart contracts using the [`Read`](/unity/contracts/read) and [`Write`](/unity/contracts/write) methods.
2. Using special features that are available for each [extension](/contracts/build/extensions) that your smart contract implements.
3. Use our low-level [`Transaction Builder`](/unity/contracts/prepare) to prepare, build, and send transactions to your smart contract.

## Extensions

Each [extension](/contracts/build/extensions) _(i.e. Solidity interface)_ that your smart contract implements unlocks new functionality for you to use in the SDK.
For example, NFT collection smart contracts implements the [ERC721](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-721/ERC721) extension,
allowing you can to use the [ERC721](/unity/contracts/erc721/erc721) extension in the SDK when interacting with that contract.

These extension interfaces are available for the most common EIP standards, including support for ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, permissions, metadata,
and more. They handle the pre-processing of calling the smart contract functions for you, such as checking for token approval, uploading metadata to IPFS, formatting inputs, etc.
Making your code safer and easier to write.
