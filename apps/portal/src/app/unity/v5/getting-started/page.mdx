# Getting Started

<Callout variant='info' title="API Key Required">

To get started with the Unity SDK, you will need to have a [thirdweb API Key](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key) created. Make sure you allowlist a bundle ID to use within Unity native applications.

</Callout>

To get started, you'll need to [download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor](https://unity.com/download).

We recommend using the 2022 LTS version of Unity.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Unity Package Download" >

Download the latest thirdweb Unity SDK package from the [releases page](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity/releases).

</Step>

<Step title="Unity Package Import" >

Drag and drop the package into your Unity project. 

</Step>

<Step title="Test it!" >

Play around in our example `Scene_Playground` to test out the SDK!

</Step>

<Step title="Build it!" >

Refer to the [Build Instructions](/unity/v5/build-instructions), pick a target platform and build your scene!

We support all platforms.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Thirdweb Manager

Now you're ready to use the SDK in your own scene!

We recommend adding a [ThirdwebManager](/unity/v5/thirdwebmanager) prefab to your scene.

Navigate to `Thirdweb` > `Runtime` > `Unity` > `Prefabs` and drag the `ThirdwebManager` into your scene.

Alternatively, use our handy quickstart installer from the top level `Tools > Thirdweb` menu.
