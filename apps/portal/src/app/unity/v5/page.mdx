## Installation

The Unity SDK is distributed as an [Asset Package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetPackages.html) allowing you to view and edit the source code.

It also wraps our open-source gaming-focused [.NET SDK](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dotnet) making version updates extremely simple containing a single DLL filechange.

You can download the latest version of the SDK from our [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases).
