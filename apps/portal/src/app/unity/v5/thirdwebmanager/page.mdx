# Thirdweb Manager

The `ThirdwebManager` is a prefab that provides a convenient way to instantiate the [ThirdwebClient](/dotnet/client), and contains helper functions to create contracts and wallets. 
Add the prefab to your scene and the client will persist throughout your game's lifecycle, keeping track of your connected wallets.

It is entirely optional, and you can opt to use the [.NET SDK](/dotnet) directly if you prefer to do so.

## Configuration

Configure `ThirdwebManager` through the Unity Inspector window.

Below is a list of all the settings you can adjust.

### Client Settings

This section involves the basic settings to configure the SDK:

- `Client ID`: Thirdweb [API Key](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key). Used to access thirdweb services such as RPC, Storage, and Account Abstraction.
- `Bundle ID`: The bundle ID used to access thirdweb services from native platforms. Should be the same as the bundle ID in your Unity project, e.g., `com.companyname.gamename`.
- `Initialize On Awake`: Whether the SDK should initialize on awake or not. If not, you can call `ThirdwebManager.Instance.Initialize()` to initialize it manually.
- `Show Debug Logs`: Whether to show thirdweb SDK debug logs.
- `Opt Out Usage Analytics`: Whether to opt out of Connect usage analytics, such as the number of wallets connected to your game.

### Wallet Settings

This section allows you to define wallet-specific settings:

- `Supported Chains`: A list of chains that the wallets should be able to connect to by default. Each chain is defined by a chain ID.

## Interacting with the ThirdwebManager

Once your `ThirdwebManager` is set up, you can interact with it using the following methods:

### Initialize

```csharp
ThirdwebManager.Instance.Initialize();
```

Initializes the SDK with the settings specified in the Unity Inspector.

### GetContract

```csharp
var contract = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.GetContract("contract-address", chainId, "optional-contract-abi");
var result = await contract.Read<string>("name");
```

Returns a [ThirdwebContract](/dotnet/contracts/create) instance that can be used to interact with a smart contract.

### GetActiveWallet

```csharp
var wallet = ThirdwebManager.Instance.GetActiveWallet();
```

Returns the currently active wallet as an `IThirdwebWallet`.

### SetActiveWallet

```csharp
ThirdwebManager.Instance.SetActiveWallet(wallet);
```

Sets the specified wallet as the active wallet.

### GetWallet

```csharp
var wallet = ThirdwebManager.Instance.GetWallet("wallet-address");
```

Returns a wallet from the manager's wallet mapping by its address.

### AddWallet

```csharp
var wallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.AddWallet(wallet);
```

Adds a wallet to the manager's wallet mapping and returns the added wallet.

### RemoveWallet

```csharp
ThirdwebManager.Instance.RemoveWallet("wallet-address");
```

Removes a wallet from the manager's wallet mapping by its address.

### ConnectWallet

```csharp
var walletOptions = new WalletOptions(WalletProvider.PrivateKeyWallet, 421614);
var wallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.ConnectWallet(walletOptions);
var address = await wallet.GetAddress();
```

Connects a wallet based on the specified `WalletOptions` and returns an `IThirdwebWallet` instance that can be used to interact with the blockchain.

### UpgradeToSmartWallet

```csharp
var smartWallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.UpgradeToSmartWallet(wallet, chainId, smartWalletOptions);
```

Upgrades the specified wallet to a `SmartWallet`, returning a `SmartWallet` instance.

### LinkAccount

```csharp
var linkedAccounts = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.LinkAccount(mainWallet, walletToLink, otp, chainId, jwtOrPayload);
```

Links another `InAppWallet` account to the main wallet and returns a list of linked accounts, allowing you to login with either authentication method later.

## Child Prefabs

### InAppWalletModal

The `InAppWalletModal` prefab is a simple and customizable OTP verification modal for `InAppWallet` providers. It is used to verify and finalize the user's wallet connection.

It will be automatically activated when connecting to an `InAppWallet` provider.

### WalletConnectModal

The `WalletConnectModal` prefab is an out-of-the-box WalletConnect modal that can be used to connect to 400+ wallets.

It will be automatically activated when connecting to a `WalletConnect` provider.
