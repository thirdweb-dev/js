# MetaMaskWallet

`MetaMaskWallet` is the most popular external wallet provider that allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet to your game.

This connection method allows you to connect to the browser extension and is only available for WebGL builds.

Use [WalletConnectWallet](/unity/v5/wallets/walletconnect) if you are building for standalone or mobile runtime platforms.

### Connecting using MetaMask

```csharp
var options = new WalletOptions(provider: WalletProvider.MetaMaskWallet, chainId: 1);
var wallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.ConnectWallet(options);
```

Will prompt the user to connect their MetaMask browser extension to your game.
