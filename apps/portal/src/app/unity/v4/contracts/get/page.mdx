# Connect to a deployed smart contract to start interacting with it.

## Usage

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("{{contract_address}}");
```

<Callout variant='info' title="Using contracts without an ABI">

When no ABI is passed, we will use thirdweb services to fetch it at runtime when Prepare, Read or Write are called.

This is a great way to get started quickly, but it is not recommended for production environments.

You may also use `Contract.FetchAbi` to fetch the ABI manually.

</Callout>

## Configuration

### address (required)

The address of the smart contract you want to connect to.

Must be a `string`.

### Using Contract ABI

The ABI must be a C#-escaped string without spaces or line breaks for the best experience.

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("0x...", "my-abi");
```
