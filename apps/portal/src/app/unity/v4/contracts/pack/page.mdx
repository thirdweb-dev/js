# Pack

When using the [Pack](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/Pack) smart contract, additional top-level functionality is available to use.

To access the top-level functionality, provide the `marketplace` contract type when creating the contract instance:

```csharp
Contract contract = sdk.GetContract("0x...");
Pack pack = contract.Pack;
```

## AddPackContents

Add additional tokens to the pool of tokens that can be opened from a pack.

```csharp
// Define ERC20 rewards to add to the pack
ERC20Reward erc20Reward = new ERC20Reward();
erc20Reward.contractAddress = "0x123abc";
erc20Reward.quantityPerReward = "100";

// Define ERC721 rewards to add to the pack
ERC721Reward erc721Reward = new ERC721Reward();
erc721Reward.contractAddress = "0x456def";
erc721Reward.tokenId = "12345";

// Define ERC1155 rewards to add to the pack
ERC1155Reward erc1155Reward = new ERC1155Reward();
erc1155Reward.contractAddress = "0x789ghi";
erc1155Reward.tokenId = "67890";
erc1155Reward.quantityPerReward = "5";

PackRewards packRewards = new PackRewards();
packRewards.erc20Rewards = new List<ERC20Reward>() { erc20Reward };
packRewards.erc721Rewards = new List<ERC721Reward>() { erc721Reward };
packRewards.erc1155Rewards = new List<ERC1155Reward>() { erc1155Reward };

var data = await pack.AddPackContents("{{token_id}}", packRewards);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### packId

The ID of the pack you want to add tokens to.

For example, in your pack contract you may have a common pack with ID `0` and a rare pack with ID `1`.

To add more tokens to the common pack, you would pass `"0"` as the `packId`.

Must be a `string`.

#### rewards

An instance of the `PackRewards` class containing the tokens you want to add to the pack.

</Details>

## Create

Mint a new pack NFT, which can be opened to receive rewards, to the **connected** wallet.

Each pack NFT is an ERC1155 token, which means it can have more than one quantity.

Provide the metadata for the pack NFT itself, and the rewards that can be opened from the pack.

The quantity of packs created is determined by the total number of rewards available, divided by the number of rewards per pack.
For example, if you had `20` total ERC20 rewards + `60` total ERC1155 rewards + `20` total ERC721 rewards,
and you wanted to create packs with `5` rewards each, the result would be the creation of `20` packs (100 total rewards / 5 rewards per pack = 20 packs).

```csharp
var packContents = new PackContents
{
    erc20Contents = new List<ERC20Contents>
    {
        new ERC20Contents
        {
            contractAddress = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890",
            quantityPerReward = "10",
            totalRewards = "5",
        }
    },
    erc721Contents = new List<ERC721Contents>

            quantityPerReward = "1",
            totalRewards = "1",
        }
    }
};

        external_url = "https://example.com/pack"
    },
    rewardsPerPack = "3",
    erc20Contents = packContents.erc20Contents,
    erc721Contents = packContents.erc721Contents,
    erc1155Contents = packContents.erc1155Contents
};

var data = await pack.Create(newPackInput);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### packMetadata

An `NFTMetadata` struct containing [standard metadata properties](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards).

The metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS for you before the packs are minted. The IPFS URI is then used as the metadata for the pack NFT.

#### erc20Contents

Each item in the list must contain a `contractAddress`, `quantityPerReward`, and `totalRewards` property.

#### erc721Contents

A list of ERC721 tokens to include in the pack.

Each item in the list must contain a `contractAddress` and `tokenId` property.

#### erc1155Contents

A list of ERC1155 tokens to include in the pack.

Each item in the list must contain a `contractAddress`, `tokenId`, `quantityPerReward`, and `totalRewards` property.

#### rewardsPerPack
