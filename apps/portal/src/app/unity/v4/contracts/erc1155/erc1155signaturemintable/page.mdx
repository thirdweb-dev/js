# ERC1155SignatureMintable

Allows you to utilize [signature-based minting](/glossary/signature-based-minting) of NFTs.

## Generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of NFTs.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};

var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC1155MintPayload(receiverAddress, meta, 1000);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC1155.Signature.Generate(payload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

The information you provide to the `generate` method outlines what the signature can be used for.

The `quantity`, `to`, and `metadata` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### receiverAddress

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

Must be a `string`.

#### metadata

The metadata of the NFT to mint.

Must be an `NFTMetadata` struct
containing metadata that conforms to
the [metadata standards](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards#metadata-structure).

The metadata is uploaded and pinned to IPFS before
the NFT(s) are minted.

#### quantity

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

Must be an `int`.

</Details>

## GenerateFromTokenId

Generate a signature that can be used to mint additional supply of an existing NFT in the contract.

This is the same as [`generate`](#generate) but it allows you to specify the `tokenId` of the NFT you want to mint additional supply for, rather than
providing the `metadata` of a new NFT.

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};

var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC1155MintAdditionalPayload(receiverAddress, "{{token_id}}", 1);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC1155.Signature.GenerateFromTokenId(payload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### receiverAddress

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

Must be a `string`.

#### tokenId

The `tokenId` of the NFT you want to mint additional supply for.

Must be a `string`.

#### quantity

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

Must be an `int`.

</Details>

## Mint

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};
var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC1155MintAdditionalPayload(receiverAddress, "{{token_id}}", 1);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC1155.Signature.GenerateFromTokenId(payload);

var data = await contract.ERC1155.Signature.Mint(signedPayload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### signedPayload

The payload created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

The typical pattern is the **admin** generates a signature, and the **user** uses it to mint the tokens, under the conditions specified in the signature.

</Details>

## Verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload, and prove that it was valid and was generated
by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint`/`mintBatch` functions will fail,
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```csharp
NFTMetadata meta = new NFTMetadata()
{
    name = "Unity NFT",
    description = "Minted From Unity",
    image = "ipfs://QmbpciV7R5SSPb6aT9kEBAxoYoXBUsStJkMpxzymV4ZcVc",
};
var receiverAddress = "{{wallet_address}}";
var payload = new ERC1155MintAdditionalPayload(receiverAddress, "{{token_id}}", 1);
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC1155.Signature.GenerateFromTokenId(payload);

var data = await contract.ERC1155.Signature.Verify(signedPayload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### signedPayload

The payload to verify.

### Return Value

Returns `true` if the payload is valid, `false` otherwise.

```csharp
bool
```
