# ERC20SignatureMintable

Allows you to utilize [signature-based minting](/glossary/signature-based-minting) of new tokens.

## Generate

Generate a signature that a wallet address can use to mint the specified number of tokens.

This is typically an **admin** operation, where the owner of the contract generates a signature that allows _another_ wallet to mint tokens.

```csharp
var payload = new ERC20MintPayload("{{wallet_address}}", "{{quantity}}");
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC20.Signature.Generate(payload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

The information you provide to the `generate` function outlines what the signature can be used for.

The `quantity` and `to` fields are required, while the rest are optional.

#### to

The wallet address that can use this signature to mint tokens.

This is to prevent another wallet from intercepting the signature and using it to mint tokens for themselves.

Must be a `string`.

#### quantity

The number of tokens this signature can be used to mint.

Must be a `string`

</Details>

## Mint

Mint tokens from a previously generated signature (see [`generate`](#generate)).

```csharp
var payload = new ERC20MintPayload("{{wallet_address}}", "{{quantity}}");
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC20.Signature.Generate(payload);

var data = await contract.ERC20.Signature.Mint(signedPayload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### signedPayload

The signature created by the [`generate`](#generate) function.

The typical pattern is the **admin** generates a signature, and the **user** uses it to mint the tokens, under the conditions specified in the signature.

</Details>

## Verify

Verify that a payload is correctly signed.

This allows you to provide a payload,
and prove that it was valid and was generated by a wallet with permission to generate signatures.

If a payload is not valid, the `mint` function will fail (even without this verification check),
but you can use this function to verify that the payload is valid before attempting to mint the tokens
if you want to show a more user-friendly error message.

```csharp
var payload = new ERC20MintPayload("{{wallet_address}}", "{{quantity}}");
var signedPayload = await contract.ERC20.Signature.Generate(payload);

var data = await contract.ERC20.Signature.Verify(signedPayload);
```

<Details summary="Configuration">

#### signedPayload

The payload to verify.

See [`generate`](#generate) for details.
