# Call Functions

If the functionality of your smart contract does not come under one of thirdweb's supported interfaces, use the generic `Write` method to call any function on the smart contract.

The result of the transaction can be read by awaiting the result of the `Write`.

The call will be awaited until the transaction is mined and the transaction receipt is available.

## Usage

```csharp
TransactionResult result = await contract.Write("functionName");
```

## Configuration

### functionName

The name of the function, view, mapping, variable, etc. on your smart contract.

Must be a `string`.

### transactionOverrides

Optional transaction overrides to change parameters like `value` or `gasLimit`.

Must be of type `TransactionRequest`

```csharp
TransactionResult result = await contract.Write("functionName", new TransactionRequest() { value = "100000", gasLimit = "100000" });
```

### args

The arguments to the function/variable, in the same order they are on your smart contract.

If you provide too few or too many arguments, the function will throw an error.

```csharp
BigInteger arg1 = 1234;
string arg2 = "hello world";
TransactionResult result = await contract.Write("functionName", arg1, arg2, ...);
```
