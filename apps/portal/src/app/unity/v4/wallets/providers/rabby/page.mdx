{
    // Reference to your Thirdweb SDK
    var sdk = ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK;

    // Configure the connection
    var connection = new WalletConnection(
      provider: WalletProvider.Rabby,        // The wallet provider you want to connect to (Required)
      chainId: 1                                // The chain you want to connect to (Required)
    );

    // Connect the wallet
    string address = await sdk.Wallet.Connect(connection);
