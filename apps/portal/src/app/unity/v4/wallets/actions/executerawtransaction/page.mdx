# SendRawTransaction

Executes a raw transaction to the blockchain from the connected wallet, and returns a receipt.

## Usage

Create a `TransactionRequest` struct with the raw transaction data, and pass it to this method.

The method will return the transaction receipt once the transaction is mined.

```csharp
var data = await sdk.Wallet.ExecuteRawTransaction(new TransactionRequest()
{
    from = "{{wallet_address}}", // The address the transaction is sent from.
    to = "{{wallet_address}}", // The address the transaction is directed to.
    data = "{{data}}", // The data to send with the transaction
    value = "{{value}}", // send native tokens with the contract call (wei)
    gasLimit = "{{gasLimit}}", // The maximum amount of gas this transaction is permitted to use.
    gasPrice = "{{gaspPrice}}", // The price (in wei) per unit of gas this transaction will pay.
});
```

### Returns

`TransactionReceipt`: The transaction receipt.
