# Native Account Abstraction (via EIP-7702 Smart EOAs)
Native Account Abstraction is a system that allows you to set code to an EOA, unlocking a world of possibilities to enhance their functionality. It is available since the Pectra upgrade on various chains.

Enabling it is as simple as creating an `InAppWallet` and passing the `ExecutionMode.EIP7702Sponsored` flag during creation.

```csharp
// Turn your boring EOAs into Smart EOAs!
var smartIaw = await ConnectWallet(
    new WalletOptions(
        provider: WalletProvider.InAppWallet,
        chainId: 11155111, // Sepolia supports EIP-7702
        inAppWalletOptions: new InAppWalletOptions(
            authprovider: AuthProvider.Google,
            executionMode: ExecutionMode.EIP7702Sponsored // new!
        )
    )
);
ThirdwebDebug.Log("Connected to InAppWallet: " + await smartIaw.GetAddress());

// Execute a transaction as usual, execution is managed by thirdweb seamlessly!
var receipt = await smartIaw.Transfer(11155111, await smartIaw.GetAddress(), 0);
ThirdwebDebug.Log($"Transfer receipt: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/{receipt.TransactionHash}");
```

# SmartWallet (via EIP-4337 Bundlers)

Instantiate or upgrade any other wallet to a `SmartWallet` to enable advanced blockchain interactions, including gasless transactions through Account Abstraction (ERC4337 as well as ZkSync Native AA).

Account Abstraction is a system that turns any personal wallet into a smart wallet, allowing you to sponsor gas for your users and unlocking advanced permissioning features that allow for seamless user onboarding, gasless transactions, automation and more.

We recommend using Smart Wallets as the primary wallet type for your users.

### Connecting to a Smart Wallet directly

```csharp
var smartWalletOptions = new SmartWalletOptions(sponsorGas: true)
var options = new WalletOptions(..., smartWalletOptions: smartWalletOptions);
var wallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.ConnectWallet(options);
```

### Upgrading an existing wallet to a Smart Wallet

```csharp
var smartWalletOptions = new SmartWalletOptions(sponsorGas: true)
var smartWallet = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.UpgradeToSmartWallet(
    personalWallet: myExistingIThirdwebWallet, 
    chainId: 1, 
    smartWalletOptions: smartWalletOptions
);
```
