# ThirdwebContract

`ThirdwebContract` is a wrapper around any EVM-compatible smart contract. It allows you to interact with the contract's functions easily, as well as prepare transactions.

### Instantiating a ThirdwebContract

```csharp
var contract = await ThirdwebManager.Instance.GetContract(
	address: "contract-address", 
	chainId: 1, 
	abi: "optional-abi"
);
```

That's it! You can now interact with the contract using the `ThirdwebContract`.

It contains `Read`, `Write` and `Prepare` methods to respectively read contract state, write to the contract and prepare transactions.

Furthermore, it contains shorthands such as `ThirdwebContract.ERC20_BalanceOf` to easily interact with common contract interfaces.
