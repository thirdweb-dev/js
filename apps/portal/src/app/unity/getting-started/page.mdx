# Getting Started

<Callout variant='info' title="Recommendation">

We recommend using an API key to use thirdweb’s default infrastructure services with the SDK such as RPC, Storage and Account Abstraction. If you haven’t created a key yet you can do so for free from the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

</Callout>

To get started, you'll need to [download and install the Unity Hub and Unity Editor](https://unity.com/download).

We recommend using the 2022 LTS version of Unity.

## Integration Steps

<Steps>

<Step title="Unity Package Download" >

Download the latest thirdweb Unity SDK package from the [releases page](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk/releases).

</Step>

<Step title="Unity Package Import" >

Drag and drop the package into your Unity project. Feel free to deselect common packages like Newtonsoft if you already have them.

</Step>

<Step title="Test it!" >

Play around in our example `Scene_Prefabs` to test out the SDK!

<DocImage src={prefabScene} />

</Step>

<Step title="Build it!" >

Refer to the [Build Settings](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/unity-sdk#build-instructions), pick a target platform and build your scene!

We support all platforms.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Thirdweb Manager

Now you're ready to use the SDK in your own scene!

The only requirement is to have a [ThirdwebManager](/unity/thirdwebmanager) prefab present in your scene.

Navigate to `Thirdweb` > `Core` > `Prefabs` > `ThirdwebManager` drag it into your scene.

Alternatively, use our handy quickstart installer from the top level `Tools > Thirdweb` menu.

<DocImage src={sdkInstaller} className="w-96" />

<Callout variant='info' title="How It Works">

The [ThirdwebManager](/unity/thirdwebmanager) represents your Thirdweb SDK singleton, providing a convenient interface for setting up and controlling SDK parameters directly from inspector.

Access the SDK from anywhere in your code using `ThirdwebManager.Instance.SDK`.
