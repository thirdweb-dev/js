# Deploy Contracts

You can deploy contracts via CLI or programatically.

## Deploying via CLI

From your forge or hardhat project, you can deploy your contract with a single command.

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy -k <project-secret-key>
```

You can also publish your contract to be deployable by anyone on any chain.

```bash
npx thirdweb publish -k <project-secret-key>
```



## Deploying via SDK

You can deploy contracts from ABI and bytecode.

```ts
import { deployContract } from "thirdweb/deploys";

const address = await deployContract({
  client,
  chain,
  bytecode: "0x...",
  abi: contractAbi,
  constructorParams: {
    param1: "value1",
    param2: 123,
  },
  salt, // optional: salt enables deterministic deploys
});
```

Or alternatively, you can deploy a contract from a previously published contract.

```ts
import { deployPublishedContract } from "thirdweb/deploys";

const address = await deployPublishedContract({
  client,
  chain,
  account,
  contractId: "MyPublishedContract",
  contractParams: {
    param1: "value1",
    param2: 123,
  },
  publisher: "0x...", // optional, defaults to the thirdweb deployer
});
```
