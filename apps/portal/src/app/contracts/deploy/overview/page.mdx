# Deploy

Deploy is a tool to deploy any contract to any EVM compatible chain through one simple command and an easy-to-use interface. Deploy reduces the complexities of deploying a contract by eliminating steps such as hardcoding private keys, managing RPC URLs, or running scripts to deploy your contracts.

Simply run the following command at the root of your contract directory:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy
```
