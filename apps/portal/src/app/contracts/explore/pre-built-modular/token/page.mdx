# Deploy a modular Token Contract

The modular Token contract creates digital currencies and is compliant with the ERC-20 standard. This contract defines a common set of 
rules for tokens including how they can be transferred, how transactions are approved, and how data about token balances is accessed.

### Token vs Token Drop

The Token contract does not allow users to claim tokens under the criteria of claim conditions. If you would prefer 
to set limits such as when and how your users can claim tokens defined through allowlists, release dates, and claim limits, 
please refer to the [Token Drop contract](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/ERC20CoreInitializable?module=eyJwdWJsaXNoZXIiOiJkZXBsb3llci50aGlyZHdlYi5ldGgiLCJtb2R1bGVJZCI6IkNsYWltYWJsZUVSQzIwIn0%3D&module=eyJwdWJsaXNoZXIiOiJkZXBsb3llci50aGlyZHdlYi5ldGgiLCJtb2R1bGVJZCI6IlRyYW5zZmVyYWJsZUVSQzIwIn0%3D&displayName=Modular+Token+Drop).


### Use Cases

- Sell NFTs on a marketplace in a custom token
- Create custom cryptocurrencies used as a digital currency, for payments, trading, stable-coins, ICOs, and more
- Reward users with tokens for specific actions completed in games or other applications
- Grant governance rights by using tokens to vote on protocol upgrades, decisions, allocations of treasury resources

### Default Installed Modules

- Transferable
- Mintable

### Deploy modular Token

<Callout variant="info" title="Any EVM Compatible">
	The Token contract is deployable on any EVM compatible network. [View all available networks.](https://thirdweb.com/chainlist) 
</Callout>
If you are signed in with an EOA wallet, you will be prompted to sign the transaction. After that your contract is deployed and you can begin configuring the modules.
