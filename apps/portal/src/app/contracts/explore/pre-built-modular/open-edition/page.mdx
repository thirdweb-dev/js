# Deploy a modular Open Edition contract

The Open Edition contract creates NFTs with shared metadata with unique token IDs appended to the NFTs name. Contrary to standard NFT contracts, Open Edition has an unlimited supply and users may continuously mint them increasing accessibility to a broader audience. The Open Edition contract is based on the ERC-721A contract.
