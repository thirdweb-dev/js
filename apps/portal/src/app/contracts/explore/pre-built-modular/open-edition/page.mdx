# Deploy a modular Open Edition contract

The Open Edition contract creates NFTs with shared metadata with unique token IDs appended to the NFTs name. Contrary to standard NFT contracts, Open Edition has an unlimited supply and users may continuously mint them increasing accessibility to a broader audience. The Open Edition contract is based on the ERC-721A contract. 

### Claim Settings

This contract does not require limits to the total supply of NFTs. Any settings related to claim phases may still be applied such as price per NFT, allowlists, start and end times to the phases, and NFTs per wallet. 

### Use Cases & Examples

- Timed Drops to allow unlimited purchases of NFTs within a certain window of time
- Generative art NFTs with each NFT portraying unique artwork different from previous
- Event specific drops to collect as commemorations, special promotions, and more

### Default Installed Modules

- Claimable
- OpenEditionMetadata
- Royalty
