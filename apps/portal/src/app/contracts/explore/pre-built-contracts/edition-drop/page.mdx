# Edition Drop

The **Edition Drop** contract is best used when you want to release many NFTs with the same metadata that you want users to be able to claim. This contract follows the [ERC1155 extension](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155), also known as "Semi-Fungible Tokens".

The Edition Drop contract allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can claim an NFT, which has been previously [lazy minted](/glossary/lazy-minting) by the contract admin (usually the deployer), including allowlists, release dates, and the maximum number of NFTs which can be claimed.

## Extensions

- [ERC1155](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-1155/ERC1155)

- Create NFT Memberships such as our [Early Access Cards](https://opensea.io/collection/thirdweb-community) that you want your users to claim
- Release an item in your game for a limited-time
- Create 100 NFTs based on one art piece, and allow users to claim one per wallet

## Creating & Configuring the Edition Drop

Learn how to create and configure your smart contract using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team).

### Creating an Edition Drop Contract

Deploy the edition drop contract to any EVM network using the button below.

### Lazy Minting NFTs

Lazy minting is the process of uploading your metadata for your NFT(s) without minting them _yet_.

This is useful when you want _other_ wallets to mint NFTs from your drop into their own wallets.

To lazy-mint NFT(s), click **Create** to lazy-mint a single NFT, or **Batch Upload** to lazy-mint multiple NFTs at once.

To get started, you can use one of our example files for [CSV](https://thirdweb.com/assets/examples/example.csv) or [JSON](https://thirdweb.com/assets/examples/example.json) metadata.

### Setting Claim Phases

On the Edition Drop contract, you set claim phases for each NFT, by clicking the **Claim Phases** button

A claim phase is a set of conditions that define when and how your users can claim an NFT from your drop.

**The Edition Drop contract supports multiple sequential claim phases**.

Within a claim phase, you can define:

- When the claim phase will start
- How many NFTs do you want to drop
- How much do you want to charge per NFT
- What currency do you want to use
- Which wallet addresses are allowed to mint (allowlist)
- How many NFTs can be claimed per transaction
- How many seconds do wallets have to wait between claims

To add a claim phase to a token, click **Add Initial Claim Phase**:

### Airdrop NFTs

Click **Airdrop** on the token you want to use, and upload a `.csv` file containing a list of addresses you want to airdrop NFTs to.

In the `.csv` file, you must specify an `address` column and a `quantity` column, representing the address you want to send the NFTs and how many you wish to send.
You can download our example [CSV File](https://thirdweb.com/assets/examples/airdrop.csv) to get started.

### Contract Metadata

To configure the image, name, and description of the contract, click the **Settings** tab:

### Royalty & Platform Fees

From the **Settings** tab, you also configure the royalty fee,
primary sales recipient,
and platform fee.
