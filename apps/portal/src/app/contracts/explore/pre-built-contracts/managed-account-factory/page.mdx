# Managed Account Factory

The **Managed Account Factory** contract is used to deploy upgradeable [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337s) smart wallets with role based permission control.

The `ManagedAccount` smart wallet is an **upgradeable** smart contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

App developers can issue `ManagedAccount` smart wallets programmatically by deploying a `ManagedAccountFactory` smart contract.

The admin of the `ManagedAccountFactory` contract can push upgrades to all `ManagedAccounts` that it creates. This admin does not require any permissions on the `ManagedAccount` smart wallets to do so.
An upgrade to the features of `ManagedAccount` applies to all `ManagedAccount` smart wallets created by the factory.
This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate pushing upgrades to their users' wallets.

thirdweb's smart wallets have the following features by default:

- Have multiple signers with different permissions
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens.
- Send and receive ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.
- Multicall-able.
- Store contract metadata.

## Extensions

This contract includes the following extensions:

- [Permissions](/contracts/build/extensions/general/Permissions)
- [PermissionsEnumerable](/contracts/build/extensions/general/PermissionsEnumerable)
