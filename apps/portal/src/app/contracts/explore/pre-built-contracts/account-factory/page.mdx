# Account Factory

The **Account Factory** contract is used to deploy immutable [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337) smart accounts with role based permission control.
The `Account` contract is a simple smart account contract that comes with all the basic benefits of account abstraction, along with the mentioned default features. App developers can issue `Account` smart accounts programmatically by deploying an `AccountFactory` smart contract.
The `Account` smart contract is non-upgradeable. Developers should use this wallet if they do not anticipate making any future upgrades to their users' wallets.

thirdwebâ€™s smart accounts have the following features by default:

- Have multiple signers with different permissions
- Execute transactions (single and batched).
- Send and receive native tokens.
- Send and receive ERC-721 and ERC-1155 NFTs.
- Multicall-able.
- Store contract metadata.

## Extensions

This contract includes the following extensions:

- [Permissions](/contracts/build/extensions/general/Permissions)
- [PermissionsEnumerable](/contracts/build/extensions/general/PermissionsEnumerable)
- [ContractMetadata](/contracts/build/extensions/general/ContractMetadata)
- [AccountFactory](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet-factory)
