# NFT Collection

The NFT Collection contract is suitable for when you want to have a collection of unique NFTs, but **not** "drop" or "release" them for your community to claim.

Unlike the [NFT Drop](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/nft-drop) contract, the NFT Collection contract does not **lazy mint** your NFTs. Instead, NFTs are minted immediately when they are added to the collection.

This means you can still transfer the NFTs or sell them on a [Marketplace](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/marketplace) and perform any other actions you would expect to do with an NFT.

For advanced use-cases, the NFT Collection also has [signature-based minting](/glossary/signature-based-minting) capabilities.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the NFT Collection contract to:

- Create a 1-of-many collection of your photography
- Create a 1-of-1 NFT that provides special utility
- Mint your artwork as NFTs and then sell them on a [Marketplace](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/marketplace)
- Create a community-made NFT collection
