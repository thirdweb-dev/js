# Multiwrap

The Multiwrap contract lets you wrap [ERC20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20),
[ERC721](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and
[ERC1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155)
tokens into a **new** wrapped ERC721 NFT.
The wrapped NFT can be unwrapped (burned) back into the underlying tokens.

The wrapped NFT itself also acts as an ERC721 token, which can have the metadata you'd expect of an NFT,
such as a name, image, description, etc.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Multiwrap contract to:

- Combine multiple NFTs into one NFT with new metadata
- Wrap NFTs along with ERC20 tokens to easily trade them for other NFTs
- Create a transparent "bundle" in your game, where the contents of the bundle are visible to the player
