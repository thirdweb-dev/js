# Airdrop ERC-721

Airdrop ERC721 NFTs to a list of recipients.

The `AirdropERC721` contract is suitable to use when you want to transfer ERC721 NFTs to a list of recipient addresses, where these recipients are not expected to individually claim their airdrop; they just receive it in a transfer.
When airdropping NFTs with this contract, you specify:

- The address of the NFT collection from which NFTs are being transferred.
- The owner address of the NFTs from where the NFTs will be transferred to a list of the recipients.
- An array of objects containing recipient-address and token-ids, for e.g.

```typescript
[
	{
		recipient: "0x123...",
		tokenId: 1,
	},
	{
		recipient: "0xabc...",
		tokenId: 2,
	},
];
```

note: token-owner must approve their tokens to this airdrop contract, by calling approval related function on the ERC721 contract.

**Estimated gas costs for airdropping tokens:**
Cost of airdropping `1` ERC721 token: ~`76,521` gas. Cost of airdropping each additional ERC721 token: ~`44,610` gas.
