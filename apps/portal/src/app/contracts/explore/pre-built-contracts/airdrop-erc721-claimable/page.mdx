# Airdrop ERC721 Claimable

The `AirdropERC721Claimable` contract is suitable to use when you want to airdrop ERC721 NFTs to a list of recipient addresses, where these recipients are expected to individually claim their own airdrop.

When deploying this contract, you specify:

- The address of the ERC721 NFTs being airdropped.
- The tokenIds of the NFTs to airdrop.
- The address of the owner of NFTs from whom NFTs will be transferred out in the airdrop.
- The UNIX timestamp after which the airdrop period will expire.
- A maximum claimable amount per wallet (claiming the airdrop).
- An optional merkle root allowlist for recipients permitted to claim the airdrop.

On claiming an airdrop, a recipient specifies:

- The address to transfer the claimed airdrop to.
- The total quantity to claim.
- The proof of inclusion in the merkle root allowlist, if it exists.
