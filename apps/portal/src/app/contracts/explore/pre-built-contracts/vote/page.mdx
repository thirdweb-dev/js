# Vote

The Vote contract is designed for groups such as DAOs to vote on proposals.

To use the Vote contract, you also need to have an existing ERC20 token,
such as our [token contract](/contracts/explore/pre-built-contracts/token) to act as the governance token.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Vote contract to:

- Vote to decide on organizational changes
- Vote on managing and distributing funds in a treasury
- Vote on any other proposal in an organization, such as a DAO

## Creating & Configuring the Vote

Learn how to create and configure your smart contract using the [dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard).
