# Token Drop

The Token Drop contract is a way of releasing your <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20">ERC20</a>
tokens for a set price.

It allows you to define the conditions for when and how your users can claim
your tokens; including allowlists, release dates, and claim limits.

In the Token Drop, you define the price for your tokens in each claim phase and can set a
limit on how many tokens you want to release. Other users can then claim your tokens under
the conditions you defined.

## Use Cases & Examples

You could use the Token Drop contract to:

- Release your new cryptocurrency for a set price such as 1 MATIC per token.
- Allow a specific set of wallets to claim your ERC20 tokens before releasing them to the public.
- Allow users to claim your tokens up until a specific date.
