# Listening to Events

The recommended way to listen to contract events is to use the [`getContractEvents`](/references/typescript/v5/getContractEvents) function and passing a prepared event with the Solidity event signature and the params. This is type-safe based on the Solidity event signature you define. You can get your desired contract event signature from the solidity code directly.

```ts
import { getContractEvents, prepareEvent } from "thirdweb";

const myEvent = prepareEvent({
  signature: "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)",
});

const events = await getContractEvents({
  contract: myContract,
  events: [myEvent],
});
```

### Using standard event definitions

You can also use the standard event definitions from the SDK to define the events you want to listen to.

```ts
import { getContractEvents } from "thirdweb";
import { transferEvent } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";

const events = await getContractEvents({
  contract: myContract,
  events: [transferEvent()],
});
```

### Generating all read functions and events for a deployed contract

Using the CLI, you can generate optimized functions for all the possible calls to a contract. This saves you time and precomputes all the necessary encoding.

```shell
npx thirdweb generate <contractId>/<contractAddress>
```
