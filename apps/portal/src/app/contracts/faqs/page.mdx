# Contracts FAQs

<Details summary="Can I use thirdweb tools with my existing contract?">
Yes, thirdwebâ€™s contract dashboard, deployment tools, and SDKs / APIs are compatible with non-thirdweb contracts. 

You can use thirdweb's deploy tool to deploy any contract that has not been deployed to any compatible EVM chain.

For any already deployed contracts, you can use the thirdweb dashboard to import them and manage

</Details>

<Details summary="Are thirdweb contracts audited?">
Yes, thirdweb pre-built contracts are audited by third-party security firms. You can see the attached
audit reports for each contract linked on the contract page on Explore. 
</Details>

<Details summary="Why can I no longer deploy a pack contract?">
Pack contracts were officially deprecated after the Pectra release from Ethereum. The pack contract implementation is incompatible with the Pectra update, which introduced breaking changes to the Ethereum protocol. As a result, support for pack contracts has been removed from thirdweb's deployment tools to ensure compatibility and security.

If you need similar functionality, consider using:
- **Edition Drop contracts** for distributing multiple quantities of NFTs
- **Marketplace contracts** for trading and bundle functionality
- **Custom smart contracts** built with our modular contract framework

For existing pack contracts, they will continue to function on-chain, but new deployments are no longer supported.
