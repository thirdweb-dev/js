# Contracts FAQs

<Details summary="Can I use thirdweb tools with my existing contract?">
Yes, thirdwebâ€™s contract dashboard, deployment tools, and SDKs / APIs are compatible with non-thirdweb contracts. 

You can use thirdweb's deploy tool to deploy any contract that has not been deployed to any compatible EVM chain.

For any already deployed contracts, you can use the thirdweb dashboard to import them and manage

<Details summary="Does it cost money to deploy contracts on thirdweb?">
Only thirdweb pre-built contracts have mint fees or fees taken on primary sales for the following contracts which have a primary recipient field:

- Drop Contracts: DropERC20, DropERC721, DropERC1155, OpenEdition
- Token Contracts: TokenERC20, TokenERC721, TokenERC1155
- Specialized Contracts: , LoyaltyCard, BurnToClaim, MarketplaceV3

There is a 2% convenience fee for deploying from the dashboard and a 0.5% protocol fee that is integrated into the contract. 

The 2.5% fee will be automatically deducted from primary sales executed through these contracts. For example, an asset listed at 0.1 ETH will distribute 0.0975 ETH to the seller and 0.0025 ETH to the platform.

The fee applies only to prebuilt contracts deployed via the thirdweb dashboard. Custom contracts or externally deployed contracts are not subject to fees. 

The fee is charged from the primary sale, including a claim or mint action when there is a price on the NFT (non-zero). The fee is paid in the same currency as the claiming or minting price.

<Details summary="Are thirdweb contracts audited?">
Yes, thirdweb pre-built contracts are audited by third-party security firms. You can see the attached
audit reports for each contract linked on the contract page on Explore.

<Details summary="Why can I no longer deploy a pack contract?">
Pack contracts were officially deprecated after the Pectra release from Ethereum. The pack contract implementation is incompatible with the Pectra update, which introduced breaking changes to the Ethereum protocol. As a result, support for pack contracts has been removed from thirdweb's deployment tools to ensure compatibility and security.

If you need similar functionality, consider using:
- **Edition Drop contracts** for distributing multiple quantities of NFTs
- **Marketplace contracts** for trading and bundle functionality
- **Custom smart contracts** built with our modular contract framework

For existing pack contracts, they will continue to function on-chain, but new deployments are no longer supported.
