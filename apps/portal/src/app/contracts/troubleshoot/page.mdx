# Contracts Troubleshooting Guides

<Details summary="Can I use thirdweb tools with my existing contract?">
Yes, thirdweb contract dashboard, deployment tools, and SDKs / APIs are compatible with non-thirdweb contracts. 

You can use thirdweb's deploy tool to deploy any contract that has not been deployed to any compatible EVM chain.

For any already deployed contracts, you can use the thirdweb dashboard to import them and manage their functionality.
