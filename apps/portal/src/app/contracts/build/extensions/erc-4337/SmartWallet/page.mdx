# BaseAccount

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/utils/BaseAccount.sol";
```

The `BaseAccount` smart contract is an extension that is intended to be used when creating your own smart account contract
which does not use one of our ready-to-use base-contract account smart contracts.

It is abstract, allowing you to customize the functionality for your use case.

<Callout title="info" variant="info">
	This smart contract extension conforms to the `IAccount` interface which is
	detectable on the dashboard as the `SmartWallet` extension.
</Callout>

## Usage

The `BaseAccount` extension is an _abstract contract_, and expects you to implement the following functions by yourself:

| Name                 | Type        | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `entryPoint`         | public view | Return the current entryPoint used by this account. |
| `_validateSignature` | internal    | Validate the signature is valid for this message.   |
| `_validateNonce`     | internal    | Validate the nonce of the UserOperation.            |

This is an example factory smart contract demonstrating how to inherit from this extension and override the functions to add (optional) custom functionality.

## Full API reference

<Details summary="getNonce">

This method returns the next sequential nonce.

```solidity
function getNonce() public view virtual returns (uint256) {
    return entryPoint().getNonce(address(this), 0);
}
```

</Details>

<Details summary="entryPoint">

Subclass should return the current entryPoint used by this account.

```solidity
function entryPoint() public view virtual returns (IEntryPoint);
```

</Details>

<Details summary="validateUserOp">

Validate user's signature and nonce.

Subclass doesn't need to override this method. Instead, it should override the specific internal validation methods.

```solidity
function validateUserOp(
    UserOperation calldata userOp,
    bytes32 userOpHash,
    uint256 missingAccountFunds
) external virtual override returns (uint256 validationData) {
    _requireFromEntryPoint();
    validationData = _validateSignature(userOp, userOpHash);
    _validateNonce(userOp.nonce);
    _payPrefund(missingAccountFunds);
}
```

</Details>

<Details summary="_requireFromEntryPoint">

Ensure the request comes from the known entrypoint.

```solidity
function _requireFromEntryPoint() internal view virtual {
    require(msg.sender == address(entryPoint()), "account: not from EntryPoint");
}
```

</Details>

<Details summary="_validateSignature">

Validate the signature is valid for this message.

```solidity
function _validateSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash)
    internal
    virtual
    returns (uint256 validationData);
```

#### userOp

Validate the userOp.signature field

#### userOpHash

the hash of the request, to check the signature against (also hashes the entrypoint and chain id)

### Return value

signature and time-range of this operation:

- `sigAuthorizer` - 0 for valid signature, 1 to mark signature failure, otherwise, an address of an "authorizer" contract.
- `validUntil` - last timestamp this operation is valid. 0 for "indefinite"
- `validAfter` - first timestamp this operation is valid.

</Details>

<Details summary="_validateNonce">

Validate the nonce of the UserOperation.
To limit the nonce to use sequenced UserOps only (no "out of order" UserOps):

- `require(nonce < type(uint64).max)`

For a hypothetical account that _requires_ the nonce to be out-of-order:

- `require(nonce & type(uint64).max == 0)`

The actual nonce uniqueness is managed by the EntryPoint, and thus no other action is needed by the account itself.

```solidity
function _validateNonce(uint256 nonce) internal view virtual {}
```

#### nonce

`uint256` representing the nonce to validate.

</Details>

<Details summary="_payPrefund">

Sends to the entrypoint (msg.sender) the missing funds for this transaction.
Subclass MAY override this method for better funds management

For example, send to the entryPoint more than the minimum required, so that in future transactions it will not be required to send again.

```solidity
function _payPrefund(uint256 missingAccountFunds) internal virtual {
    if (missingAccountFunds != 0) {
        (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{ value: missingAccountFunds, gas: type(uint256).max }("");
        (success);
        //ignore failure (its EntryPoint's job to verify, not account.)
    }
}
```

#### missingAccountFunds

The minimum value this method should send the entrypoint.
This value MAY be zero, in case there is enough deposit, or the userOp has a paymaster.
