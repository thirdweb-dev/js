# Managed Account

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/managed/ManagedAccount.sol";
```

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccount`](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet) contract.

The `ManagedAccount` is an _upgradeable_ smart account contract written in the [dynamic contract pattern](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/dynamic-contracts).

App developers can issue `ManagedAccount` smart accounts programmatically by deploying a [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account-factory) smart contract.

The admin of the [`ManagedAccountFactory`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account-factory) contract can push upgrades to all `ManagedAccount` contracts that it creates. This admin does not require any permissions on the `ManagedAccount` smart account to do so.

An upgrade to the features of `ManagedAccount` applies to **all** `ManagedAccount` smart accounts created by the factory. This is the right wallet for developers who anticipate **pushing upgrades** to their usersâ€™ wallets.

<Callout title="Issue accounts programatically" variant="info">

If you intend to issue accounts programmatically using a custom factory contract, you must do the following:

- Create a new factory contract by extending the [BaseAccountFactory](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet-factory) extension.

- Override the `_initializeAccount` function on the factory to create a new wallet. ([reference](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/smart-wallet/non-upgradeable/AccountFactory.sol#L36))

</Callout>

## Detected Extensions

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these extensions on the SDK and dashboard:

- [SmartWallet](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet)
- [Multicall](/contracts/build/extensions/general/Multicall)

## Usage

Import the contract and inherit from it. This is an example contract demonstrating one way that you could override the functionality to create a token bound account.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/managed/ManagedAccount.sol";

contract ManagedTokenBoundAccount is ManagedAccount {
    constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint
    )
        ManagedAccount(
            _entrypoint
        )
    {}
}
```

## Functions to Override

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<Details id="initialize" summary="initialize">

Initializes the smart contract wallet.

```solidity
function initialize(address _defaultAdmin, bytes calldata _data) public virtual initializer {
    factory = msg.sender;
    _setupRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _defaultAdmin);
}
```

#### \_defaultAdmin

The account admin. Must be of type `address`.

#### \_data

The abi encoded data to initialize the contract with. Must be of type `bytes`.

</Details>

<Details id="getImplementationForFunction" summary="getImplementationForFunction">

Returns the extension implementation address, stored in the router, for the given function.

```solidity
function getImplementationForFunction(bytes4 _functionSelector) public view virtual override returns (address) {
    return Router(payable(factory)).getImplementationForFunction(_functionSelector);
}
```

#### \_functionSelector

The function selector to get the extension implementation address. Must be of type `bytes4`.

</Details>

<Details id="isValidSigner" summary="isValidSigner">

Returns whether a signer is authorized to perform transactions using the wallet.

```solidity
function isValidSigner(address _signer) public view virtual returns (bool) {
    return _hasRole(SIGNER_ROLE, _signer) || _hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, _signer);
}
```

#### \_signer

The signer to check authorization for. Must be of type `address`.

</Details>

<Details id="entryPoint" summary="entryPoint">

Returns the entry point contract address.

```solidity
function entryPoint() public view virtual override returns (IEntryPoint) {
    return entrypointContract;
}
```

</Details>

<Details id="_validatesSignature" summary="_validatesSignature">

Validates the signature of a user operation.

```solidity
function _validateSignature(UserOperation calldata userOp, bytes32 userOpHash)
    internal
    virtual
    override
    returns (uint256 validationData)
{
    bytes32 hash = userOpHash.toEthSignedMessageHash();
    address signer = hash.recover(userOp.signature);

    if (!isValidSigner(signer)) return SIG_VALIDATION_FAILED;
    return 0;
}
```

</Details>
