# What are Modular Contracts?

Modular contracts is a framework that enables the creation of highly customizable and 
upgradeable smart contracts. Modular contracts is designed to encompass a broad number 
of use cases without compromising on the ease and security of creating smart contracts 
with thirdweb.

Modular contracts are composed of two components:

- **Core Contract**: smart contracts that serve as the foundation of the modular contract
- **Module Contract**: smart contracts that are installed on top of the core contract

You can think of Modular Contracts like building bricks. Pick a core, install modules, 
and swap them out to enable different functionality.
