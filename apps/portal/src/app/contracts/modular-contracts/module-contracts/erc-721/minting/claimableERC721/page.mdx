# Claimable ERC-721

## Description

The `ClaimableERC721` contract is an module that provides claim-based minting functionality for ERC-721 tokens. It includes features for setting claim conditions, validating claims via Merkle proofs, and handling signature-based claim requests. This contract ensures secure and controlled minting processes with the possibility of integrating primary sales.
