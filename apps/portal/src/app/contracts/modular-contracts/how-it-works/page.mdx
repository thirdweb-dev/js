### How Do Modular Contracts Work

Modular contracts are composed of two core components:

1. **Core Contracts**
2. **Module Contracts**

Core contracts serve as the foundation upon which module contracts are installed. Module contracts are smart contracts that provide additional functionality and can be installed or uninstalled from a core contract. You can think of core and module contracts as building blocks, like Lego pieces.

#### How Do Module Contracts Supply Additional Functionality?

Once installed, module contracts provide additional functionality by creating `fallback` and `callback` functions that the core contract can interact with through delegate calls.

- **Fallback functions** are independent functions that can be called through the core contract.
- **Callback functions** are dependent functions that must be called within the context of a core contract function. These functions enhance the core contract's functionality by executing additional logic either before or after the main core contract logic.

#### How Are Module Contracts Installed onto Core Contracts?

Like Lego pieces, modular contracts must "fit" together properly. If the pieces don't align—meaning the contracts aren't compatible—they cannot be installed together.

This raises the question:

#### What Makes a Module Contract Compatible with a Core Contract?

Two factors determine compatibility: **interfaces** and **callback functions**.

- If a module contract has a callback function that the core contract doesn’t support (or is already in use), it can’t be installed.
- Similarly, if a module contract requires a certain interface to be supported by the core contract and it doesn’t have it, then it can’t be installed.

#### How Core and Module Contracts Communicate

Core contracts expose their supported callback functions and interfaces through two methods:

- `getSupportedCallbackFunctions` - to expose the core contract’s supported callback functions.
- `supportsInterface` - to expose the core contract’s supported interfaces.

Module contracts also expose their supplied callback and fallback functions, along with the required interfaces, via the `getModuleConfig` function.

#### Example: Core and Module Contract Interaction

Let’s walk through an example with three contracts:
- `ERC721Core`
- `MintableModule`
- `TransferableModule`

##### `ERC721Core` Example

The `ERC721Core` contract supports the `beforeMint` callback and the ERC-721 interface (`0x80ac58cd`).

```solidity
function getSupportedCallbackFunctions()
	public
	pure
	override
	returns (SupportedCallbackFunction[] memory supportedCallbackFunctions)
{
	supportedCallbackFunctions = new SupportedCallbackFunction ;
	supportedCallbackFunctions[0] = SupportedCallbackFunction({
		selector: BeforeMintCallback.beforeMint.selector,
		mode: CallbackMode.REQUIRED
	});
}

function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
	public
	view
	override(ERC721AUpgradeable, IERC721AUpgradeable, Core)
	returns (bool)
{
	return interfaceId == 0x80ac58cd // ERC165 Interface ID for ERC721 
		|| super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
}
```

##### `MintableModule` Example

The `MintableModule` provides the `beforeMint` callback and requires the ERC-721 interface.

```solidity
function getModuleConfig() external pure override returns (ModuleConfig memory config) {
	config.callbackFunctions = new CallbackFunction ;
	config.callbackFunctions[0] = CallbackFunction(this.beforeMint.selector);
	
	config.requiredInterfaces = new bytes4 ;
	config.requiredInterfaces[0] = 0x80ac58cd; // ERC721.
}
```

##### `TransferableModule` Example

The `TransferableModule` provides the `beforeTransfer` callback and also requires the ERC-721 interface.

```solidity
function getModuleConfig() external pure override returns (ModuleConfig memory config) {
	config.callbackFunctions = new CallbackFunction ;
	config.callbackFunctions[0] = CallbackFunction(this.beforeTransfer.selector);
	
	config.requiredInterfaces = new bytes4 ;
	config.requiredInterfaces[0] = 0x80ac58cd; // ERC721.
}
```

##### Compatibility in Action

The `ERC721Core` contract supports the ERC-721 interface (`0x80ac58cd`), which is required by both the `MintableModule` and the `TransferableModule`.

However, since `ERC721Core` only supports the `beforeMint` callback, only the `MintableModule` can be installed. The `TransferableModule`, which provides the `beforeTransfer` callback, cannot be installed because `ERC721Core` does not support it.

---

#### Conclusion

Modular contracts work by allowing core contracts to interact with module contracts through delegate calls to `fallback` and `callback` functions. Compatibility between core and module contracts is determined by their supported interfaces and callback functions. This modular architecture provides flexibility, allowing functionality to be added or removed as needed, like assembling or disassembling Lego pieces.
