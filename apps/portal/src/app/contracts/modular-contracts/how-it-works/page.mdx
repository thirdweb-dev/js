# How it works

A modular contract is composed of two types of contracts:

- Core Contract: the foundational API to be customized by installing extensions
- Extension Contract: implement a set of functionality to be enabled on a Core Contract upon installation

As an analogy, think of a robot in which the torso is the Core with available sockets for attaching extensions.

The torso has a particular shape and exposes sockets at fixed places, determining how extensions will be attached. Similarly, a Core smart contract has a fixed API determining which extensions are compatible with installation.

TheÂ *Extensions*, e.g., a leg, arm, head, etc., give the robot (i.e., the modular contract) various capabilities.
