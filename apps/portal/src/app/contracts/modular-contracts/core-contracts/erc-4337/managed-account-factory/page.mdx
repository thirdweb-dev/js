# Managed Account Factory

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/managed/ManagedAccountFactory.sol";
```

This contract inherits from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet-factory) contract.

This factory smart contract is intended to be used to distribute ['ManagedAccounts`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account) programmatically.

<GithubButtonLink href="https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/contracts/blob/main/contracts/prebuilts/account/managed/ManagedAccountFactory.sol" />

<Callout title="Modified Contract" variant="info">

If you modify the [`ManagedAccount`](/contracts/build/base-contracts/erc-4337/managed-account) contract, it is recommended that you write your own
factory contract by inheriting from the [`BaseAccountFactory`](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet-factory) extension.

</Callout>

## Detected Extensions

Once deployed, you can use the features made available by these extensions on the SDK and dashboard:

- [SmartWalletFactory](/contracts/build/extensions/erc-4337/SmartWallet-factory)

## Usage

Use the [CLI](/cli) [`create`](/cli/create) command to create a `ManagedAccountFactory` smart contract:

```bash
npx thirdweb create contract
```

[Deploy](/contracts/deploy/overview) your contract using the deploy cli command:

```bash
npx thirdweb create
```

Or import the contract into your existing project and inherit from it.

```solidity
import "@thirdweb-dev/contracts/smart-wallet/managed/ManagedAccountFactory.sol";

contract MyManagedAccountFactory is ManagedAccountFactory {
	  constructor(
        IEntryPoint _entrypoint
    )
        ManagedAccountFactory(
            _entrypoint
        )
    {}
}
```

## Functions to Override

The following functions have been implemented on this contract & are available to be overridden to add custom logic:

<Details id="_initializeAccount" summary="_initializeAccount">

Called in `createAccount`. Initializes the account contract created in `createAccount`.

```solidity
function _initializeAccount(
    address _account,
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) internal override {
    ManagedAccount(payable(_account)).initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```

#### \_account

The address of the smart account smart contract to initialize.

#### \_admin

The address to be set as default admin role for the contract. Must be of type `address`.

#### \_data

If extra storage variables are required in your account contract, abi encode the variables,
pass them to this function as the `bytes` argument.

For example:

```solidity

function initializeAccount(
    address _admin,
    bytes calldata _data
) public override initializer {
    ManagedAccount.initialize(_admin, _data);
}
```

</Details>

<Details id="_canSetExtension" summary="_canSetExtension">

Returns whether an extension can be set in the given execution context.

```solidity
function _canSetExtension() internal view virtual override returns (bool) {
    return hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);
}
```

</Details>
