# Deploy a Modular Contract

This guide will show you how to publish a Modular Contract that increments a counter. If you're interested in learning how modular contracts work, refer to [How it works](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/modular-contracts/how-it-works).
If you haven't read through [Create a Core Contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/modular-contracts/get-started/create-core-contact) and [Create a Module Contract](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contracts/modular-contracts/get-started/create-module-contract), please do so before proceeding
as this guide will build on top of those previous guides.

<Steps>

<Step title="Grab an API Key from the thirdweb Dashboard">
Go to the [thirdweb Dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team), Create a new Project to obtain API Key

<DocImage src={ createApiKey } />

A dialog should pop up asking for the name of the key. Use `modular-contract-test-key`.

<DocImage src={ apiKeyName } />

Click "Proceed".

<DocImage src={ proceed } />

Then, click on the copy icon and store the API key in a secure place.

<DocImage src={ copyApiKey } />
</Step>

<Step title="Publish the Module Contract">
In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx thirdweb publish -k "THIRDWEB_API_KEY"
```
Replace `THIRDWEB_API_KEY` with your API key. Then, select `CounterModule`.

<DocImage src={ selectCounterModule } />

It should open up your browser. Scroll to the bottom and click "Next".

<DocImage src={ scrollAndNext } />

Then, choose the Sepolia network and click "Publish Contract".

<DocImage src={ publishContract } />

Now, we can move on to deploying the core contract.
</Step>

<Step title="Deploy the Core Contract">
In your terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npx thirdweb deploy -k "THIRDWEB_API_KEY"
```
Replace `THIRDWEB_API_KEY` with your API key. Choose `CounterCore`.

<DocImage src={ selectCounterCore } />

It should open up your browser. Input the `owner` of the contract and click "Deploy Now".

<DocImage src={ inputOwner } />

Then, choose the Sepolia chain and click "Deploy Now".

<DocImage src={ sepoliaDeployNow } />

It should now be deploying.

<DocImage src={ deploying } />

Once the core contract has been deployed, click "View Contract".
</Step>

<Step title="Install the Module">
On the contract dashboard, click on "Modules" in the left-hand sidebar.

<DocImage src={ contractDashboardModules } />

You will be redirected to the "Edit Modules" page, where you can install the `CoreModule`. Under the "Publisher" input, paste in the address of the publisher you used.

Then, the "Module Name" input will unlock. Click on that and select `counterModule`. Once it finishes checking eligibility, select "Module Version" as 1.0.0 and choose whichever step you wish to use.

Finally, click "Install".

<DocImage src={ installModule } />

Now the module has been successfully installed.

<DocImage src={ moduleInstalled } />
</Step>

</Steps>

---

And there you have it! You have now deployed your very own Modular Contract!
