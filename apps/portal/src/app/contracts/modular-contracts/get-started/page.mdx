The Get Started documentation for Modular Contracts guides you through building and deploying an example modular contract that increments a counter. It also shows you how to build an application using this contract.

**Prerequisites:** 
This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Solidity and the thirdweb SDK. 
If you are new to Solidity, we recommend starting with the [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/) and the [thirdweb SDK docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/typescript/v5/getting-started).

### Objectives
