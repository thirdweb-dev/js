# Modular Contracts

Modular contracts is an open source framework that enables the creation of highly customizable and upgradeable smart contracts. Modular contracts is designed to encompass a broad number of use cases without compromising on the ease and security of creating smart contracts with thirdweb.

Modular contracts are composed of two components:

- Core Contract: smart contracts that serve as the foundation of the modular contract
- Module Contract: smart contracts that are installed on top of the core contract

You can think of Modular Contracts like building bricks. Pick a core, install modules, and swap them out to enable different functionality.

<Details summary="What are modular contracts good for?">
Modular contracts pattern is useful in the context of sharing core or modular contracts with other teams / developers while giving them control over the contract. 
It is useful for creating a contract where you need to upgrade the core contract by adding new functionality through modules.
