# Modular Contracts

**Modular Contracts** are contracts for which you can add, remove, or upgrade the exact parts you want.

## Getting started

To get started, install the `modular-contracts` package in your existing Solidity project:

<Tabs defaultValue="forge">

<TabsList>
	<TabsTrigger value="forge">Forge</TabsTrigger>
</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="forge">
```bash
forge install https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/modular-contracts
```
</TabsContent>
<TabsContent value="hardhat">
```bash
npm i @thirdweb-dev/contracts
```
</TabsContent>
</Tabs>

A modular contract is made up of [1] a **Core** and [2] **Module** contracts. Learn more about these, below.

Follow this [end-to-end guide](https://blog.thirdweb.com/p/d45e40f7-e8f3-4bcd-be6b-f800beff963f/)
to learn how to write, deploy and use your own custom modular contract.

## Background

A modular contract is made up of two kinds of contracts:

1. **Core** contract: the foundational API that can be customized by installing Modules.
2. **Module** contract: implements a set of functionality that is enabled on a Core when it is installed.

<Callout variant="info">
	As an analogy, think of the robot, below. The torso is the *Core* to which you
	attach/detach *Modules*. 
    
    The torso has a particular shape and exposes sockets at fixed places -- all of which determine how modules will be attached to it. Similarly,
    a Core smart contract has a fixed API that determines what Modules are compatible for installation.

    The *Modules* themselves e.g. a leg, arm, head, etc. give the robot (i.e. the modular contract as a whole) its various capabilities.

Installing a Module in a Core customizes the Core’s behaviour in two ways:

1. New functions become callable on the Core contract (via its [fallback function](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.26/contracts.html#fallback-function)).
2. Core contract’s fixed functions make callback function calls into the Module.

You can read about the full technical design details of Modular Contracts in its [design document](/contracts/design-docs/modular-contracts).
