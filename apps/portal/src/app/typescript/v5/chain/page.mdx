# Chain

The thirdweb SDK works with **any EVM chain**.

All you need to connect a chain is its chain id. RPC connection to the chain is handled for you.

```ts
import { defineChain } from "thirdweb";

const myChain = defineChain(myChainId);
```

The SDK comes with predefined popular chains like `base`, `polygon`, and more exported from the `thirdweb/chains` entrypoint.

```ts
import { polygon } from "thirdweb/chains";

const myChain = polygon;
```

### Configuring chains (Advanced)

You can also configure chains with custom RPC endpoints, native currency, block explorers, and more.

```ts
const myChain = defineChain({
  id: myChainId,
  rpc: "https://my-custom-rpc.com",
  ...
})
```
