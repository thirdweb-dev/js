# Accounts & Wallets

We distinguish between "accounts" and "wallets" in the thirdweb SDK. We believe this ultimately provides a more predictable and flexible API for developers.

## What is an Account?

- An account always has an `address` and a way to `sign` messages, transactions, and typed data.
- An account is always mapped to exactly one address on the blockchain.
- An account cannot be "connected" or "disconnected" like a wallet, instead it is often the result of a wallet being connected.

## What is a Wallet?

- A wallet "contains" one or more accounts.
- A wallet can be "connected" (often prompting the user for approval) or "disconnected".
- A wallet cannot independently sign messages, transactions, or typed data, instead, it delegates this to the account(s) it "contains".

## Example: Connect a wallet and access an account to send a transaction.

```ts
import { sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";
// We use MetaMask wallet as an example, the pattern is the same for all wallets
import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

// initialize the wallet, you can pick any of the 300+ wallet connectors supported
// wallet ids are typed, let your TS editor autocomplete them for you
// ex: "io.metamask", "com.coinbase.wallet", "me.rainbow", etc...
const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask");

// connect the wallet, this returns a promise that resolves to the connected account
const account = await wallet.connect({
	// pass the client you created with `createThirdwebClient()`
	client,
});

// sign & send a transaction with the account -> returns the transaction hash
const { transactionHash } = await sendTransaction({
	// assuming you have called `prepareTransaction()` or `prepareContractCall()` before which returns the prepared transaction to send
	transaction,
	// Pass the account to sign the transaction with
	account,
});
```
