# Connect Users to your Ecosystem

Ecosystem wallets inherit all the functionality of [in-app wallets](/references/typescript/v5/in-app-wallet), but instead of being scoped to a single app, they can be used across multiple applications.

Head over to the [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team) to create an ecosystem and obtain your ecosystem id.

## Live Playground

Try out ecosystem wallets for yourself in the [in-app wallet live playground](https://playground.thirdweb.com/connect/in-app-wallet/ecosystem)

## Configure ecosystem wallets

The only difference with in-app wallets is how you create an ecosystem wallet using the `ecosystemWallet()` function and passing your ecosystem id.

```tsx
import { ecosystemWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id");
```

## Configuring auth strategies

You can configure the allowed auth strategies on [your dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/ecosystem).

<DocImage src={EcosystemSocialConfig}/>

For prebuilt UIs, the enabled auth strategies are automatically read from your dashbaord configurations.

For custom UIs, you can configure the auth options when connecting the wallet. See [using your own UI](#using-your-own-ui) for an example. 

<Callout variant="warning" title="Using disabled auth strategies">
	Note that while you're allowed to pass any auth strategy today, we recommend only passing the strategies that are enabled on your dashboard. We might enforce this in the future.
</Callout>

## Passing a partner ID

For closed ecosystems, you can invite partners to your ecosystem. Partners will have to pass a valid `partnerId` to the `ecosystemWallet()` function in order to connect to your ecosystem.

```tsx
const wallet = ecosystemWallet("ecosystem.your-ecosystem-id", {
	partnerId: "your-partner-id",
});
```

For more information, refer to the [ecosystemWallet API reference](/references/typescript/v5/ecosystemWallet).

## Using ecosystem wallets

Refer to the [in-app wallets](/references/typescript/v5/in-app-wallet) documentation to add your ecosystem wallet to your applications.
