The SDK supports 350+ wallets out of the box, all you need to pass is their id.

These wallets include thirdweb's first-party wallets like Smart Wallet and In-App Wallet, as well as other popular wallet extensions/mobile apps.

Refer to [`createWallet`](/references/typescript/v5/createWallet) and [`injectedProvider`](/references/typescript/v5/injectedProvider) for more information.

```tsx
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";
import { createWallet, injectedProvider } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });

const metamask = createWallet("io.metamask"); // pass the wallet id

// if user has metamask installed, connect to it
if (injectedProvider("io.metamask")) {
	await metamask.connect({ client });
}

// open wallet connect modal so user can scan the QR code and connect
else {
	await metamask.connect({ client, walletConnect: { showQrModal: true } });
}
```
