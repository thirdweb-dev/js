# Preparing Transactions

All transactions sent with the SDK need to be prepared first. Preparing a transaction is synchronous, lightweight and does not require any network requests. It also gives you type-safe definitions for your contract calls.

## Preparing a contract call

The recommended way to prepare a contract call is to pass the Solidity method signature and the params. This is type-safe based on the Solidity method signature you define. You can get your desired contract method signature from the solidity code directly.

```ts
import { prepareContractCall, toWei } from "thirdweb";

const tx = prepareContractCall({
	contract,
	// Pass the method signature that you want to call
	method: "function mintTo(address to, uint256 amount)",
	// and the params for that method
	// Their types are automatically inferred based on the method signature
	params: ["0x123...", toWei("100")],
});
```

This will return a prepared transaction object that is ready to be sent to the blockchain and can be acted on in various ways.

## Preparing a raw transaction

You can also create a raw transaction directly. This is useful when you want to send ether to an address for example, or when you already have encoded data.

```ts
import { prepareTransaction, toWei } from "thirdweb";

const transaction = prepareTransaction({
	// The account that will be the receiver
	to: "0x456...",
	// The value is the amount of ether you want to send with the transaction
	value: toWei("1"),
	// The chain to execute the transaction on
	chain: defineChain(1),
	// Your thirdweb client
	client,
});
```

## Other ways to prepare a transaction

There are few other ways to prepare a contract call, all of these return the same transaction object.

### Generating extension functions for a deployed contract

Using the CLI, you can generate optimized functions for all the possible calls to a contract. This saves you time and precomputes all the necessary encoding.

```shell
npx thirdweb generate <contractId>/<contractAddress>
```

### Explicit Contract ABI

Another way to get type safety is to pass the full contract ABI to `getContract`. This will give you autocompletion for all methods declared in the ABI. There is a slight extract cost of having the full ABI in your code which can be pretty large.

```ts
import { getContract, prepareContractCall, toWei } from "thirdweb";

const contract = getContract({
  client,
	chainId,
  // The ABI for the contract is defined here
  abi: [
    ...
    {
      name: "mintTo",
      inputs: [
        {
          type: "address",
          name: "to",
        },
        {
          type: "uint256",
          name: "amount",
        },
      ],
      type: "function",
    }
    ...
  ],
});

const tx = prepareContractCall({
  contract,
  // We get auto-completion for all the available functions on the contract ABI
  method: "mintTo",
  // including full type-safety for the params
  params: ["0x123...", toWei("100")],
});
```

### ABI snippet

As an alternative to passing the full ABI, you can pass a snippet of the ABI for the method you want to call. This is useful when you only want to call a single method and don't want to have the full ABI in your code.

```ts
import { prepareContractCall, toWei } from "thirdweb";

const tx = prepareContractCall({
	contract,
	// Pass a snippet of the ABI for the method you want to call.
	method: {
		name: "mintTo",
		inputs: [
			{
				type: "address",
				name: "to",
			},
			{
				type: "uint256",
				name: "amount",
			},
		],
		type: "function",
	},
	// The Types of `params` are automatically inferred based on the ABI inputs.
	params: ["0x123...", toWei("100")],
});
```

### Automatic ABI Resolution

Finally, you can dynamically resolve contract methods at runtime using the `resolveMethod` function. This is the best way to handle contracts you don't know the ABI of in advance but it is also less performant and not type-safe.

```ts
import { prepareContractCall, resolveMethod, toWei } from "thirdweb";
const tx = prepareContractCall({
	contract,
	// in this case we only pass the name of the method we want to call
	method: resolveMethod("mintTo"),
	// however using this method we lose type safety for our params
	params: ["0x123...", toWei("100")],
});
```

<Callout title="Please note" variant="info">

This method is convenient, however, it is also:

- less performant at runtime (it has to resolve the ABI of the contract and then match the method name you provide)
- not type-safe (you lose type safety for your params)

There are cases where you specifically _need_ to be able to resolve methods dynamically at runtime, in which case this method is useful.
