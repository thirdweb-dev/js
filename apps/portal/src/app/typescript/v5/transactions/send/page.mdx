# Acting on a prepared transaction

Transactions have a variety of actions that can be called on them, in all cases this is done by passing the transaction to the various action functions.

## Sending a transaction

Send the prepared transaction to the blockchain. Sending a transaction requires a wallet.

See [Wallets](/typescript/v5/wallets) for more information on how to create a wallet.

```ts
import { sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";
import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask");
const account = await wallet.connect({ client });

const transactionResult = await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	account,
});
```

## sendAndConfirmTransaction

Send a transaction and wait for it to be mined. Useful when you want to block until the transaction is fully confirmed onchain before proceeding to the next step.

```ts
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "thirdweb";
import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask");
const account = await wallet.connect({ client });

const receipt = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({
	transaction,
	account,
});
```

## waitForReceipt

Wait for a transaction to be mined and get the transaction receipt.

```ts
import { sendTransaction, waitForReceipt } from "thirdweb";
import { createWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = createWallet("io.metamask");
const account = await wallet.connect({ client });

const transactionResult = await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	account,
});

const receipt = await waitForReceipt(transactionResult);
```

## estimateGas

Estimating gas used by a transaction

```ts
import { estimateGas } from "thirdweb";

const gasEstimate = await estimateGas({ transaction });
console.log("estmated gas used", gasEstimate);
```

## estimateGasCost

Estimating gas cost in ether and wei for a transaction

```ts
import { estimateGas } from "thirdweb";

const gasCost = await estimateGasCost({ transaction });
console.log("cost in ether", gasCost.ether);
```

## simulateTransaction

Simulate a transaction to see if it would be successful.

```ts
import { simulateTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const result = await simulateTransaction({ transaction });
console.log("simulation result", result);
```

## encode

Encode a transaction data to be used later

```ts
import { encode } from "thirdweb";

const data = await encode(transaction);
console.log("encoded data", data);
```
