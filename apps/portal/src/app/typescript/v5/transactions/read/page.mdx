# Reading contract state

The recommended way to read the contract state is to use the `readContract` function and pass the Solidity method signature and the params. This is type-safe based on the Solidity method signature you define. You can get your desired contract method signature from the solidity code directly.

```ts
import { readContract } from "thirdweb";

const balance = await readContract({
	contract: contract,
	method: "function balanceOf(address) view returns (uint256)",
	params: ["0x123..."],
});
```

This will execute the read immediately and return the result from the blockchain.

## Reading contract events

The recommended way to read the contract events is to use the `getContractEvents` function and passing a prepared event with the Solidity event signature and the params. This is type-safe based on the Solidity event signature you define. You can get your desired contract event signature from the solidity code directly.

```ts
import { getContractEvents, prepareEvent } from "thirdweb";

const myEvent = prepareEvent({
  signature: "event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)",
});

const events = await getContractEvents({
  contract: myContract,
  events: [myEvent],
  blockRange: 1000,
});
```

### Generating all read functions and events for a deployed contract

Using the CLI, you can generate optimized functions for all the possible calls to a contract. This saves you time and precomputes all the necessary encoding.

```shell
npx thirdweb generate <contractId>/<contractAddress>
```
