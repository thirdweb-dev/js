# IPFS Storage

The thirdweb SDK comes built-in with an IPFS uploader and downloader.

## Download from IPFS

```ts
import { download } from "thirdweb/storage";

const file = await download({
	client,
	uri: "ipfs://Qm...",
});
```

You can view all of the configuration options in the [full reference](/references/typescript/v5/download).

## Upload to IPFS

### Uploading JSON objects

```ts
import { upload } from "thirdweb/storage";

const uris = await upload({
	client,
	files: [
		{
			name: "something",
			data: {
				hello: "world",
			},
		},
	],
});
```

### Uploading files

```ts
import { upload } from "thirdweb/storage";

const uris = await upload({
	client,
	files: [new File(["hello world"], "hello.txt")],
});
```

You can view all of the configuration options in the [full reference](/references/typescript/v5/upload).

### Resolve IPFS uris

You can easily convert a `ipfs://` uri to a `https://` uri with your own IPFS gateway using the `resolveScheme` function.

The resolved uri will be protected by your api key settings, and only accessible to your whitelisted domains.

```ts
import { resolveScheme } from "thirdweb/storage";

const uri = await resolveScheme("ipfs://Qm...");
// resolves to https://<clientId>.ipfscdn.io/Qm...
```
