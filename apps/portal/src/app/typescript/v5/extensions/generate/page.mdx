# Generating extensions

You can generate precompiled, optimized extensions for any deployed contract using the thirdweb CLI.

The thirdweb SDK comes with a CLI that can be run with your package manager of choice.

```bash
npx thirdweb generate <chainId>/<contract-address>
```

This will generate a new `thirdweb` directory in your own project, containing the precompiled extension for the contract at the given address.

### Example: Generating an extension for a USDC contract on Optimism

```bash
npx thirdweb generate 10/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85
```

This will generate the following file `thirdweb/10/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85.ts` in your project, containing:

- Precompiled, type-safe event definitions
- Precompiled, type-safe function definitions

You can inspect the generated code, modify it, and use it in your project.

### Example: Using a generated extension function

```typescript
import { permit } from "/thirdweb/10/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain: optimism,
	address: USDC_ADDRESS,
});

// Type-safe function to do a permit transaction
const transaction = permit({
  owner: ...,
  spender: ...,
  value: ...,
  deadline: ...,
  signature: ...,
});
await sendTransaction({ transaction, account });
```

### Example: Using a generated event

```typescript
import { transferEvent } from "/thirdweb/10/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85";

const contract = getContract({
	client,
	chain: optimism,
	address: USDC_ADDRESS,
});

// Type-safe event listener
const events = await getContractEvents({
  contract,
  events: [
    transferEvent({
      from: ...,
      to: ...,
    })
  ],
});
```
