# Writing your own extensions

You can create your own extensions. They are just regular functions that pre-define the behavior of a `prepareContractCall()` or `readContract()` function.

The goal of extensions is to add a layer of convenience to direct contract calls, either to simplify the inputs or to give richer outputs.

### Example: Creating the `getBalance` extension for ERC20 tokens

The `erc20/getBalance` extension is a very convenient and efficient way to fetch all the information needed to display an ERC20 token balance to a user, a very common usecase for applications. Here is how it is implemented in the SDK.

```typescript
// Define your extension function
export function getBalance(
	// The base options include everything that is needed to interact with the contract, *except* the specific params for your function, in this case, "address"
	options: BaseTransactionOptions<{ address: string }>,
) {
	// The extension conveniently fetches all the relevant information from the contract to display a readable balance
	const [balanceWei, decimals_, symbol_, name_] = await Promise.all([
		balanceOf(options),
		decimals(options),
		symbol(options),
		name(options),
	]);
	return {
		value: balanceWei,
		decimals: decimals_,
		// The `toTokens` function converts the balance from wei to a human-readable format
		displayValue: toTokens(balanceWei, decimals_),
		symbol: symbol_,
		name: name_,
	};
}
```

### Example: Creating the `mintTo` extension for ERC721 tokens

The `erc721/mintTo` extension handles uploading the NFT metadata to IPFS before minting. Here is how it is implemented in the SDK.

```typescript
import { prepareContractCall, type BaseTransactionOptions } from "thirdweb";

// Define your extension function
export function mintTo(
	// The base options include everything that is needed to interact with the contract, *except* the specific params for your function, in this case "to" and "nft"
	options: BaseTransactionOptions<{ to: string; nft: NFTMetadata }>,
) {
	return prepareContractCall({
		// Pass the contract from the options
		contract: options.contract,
		// Pre-define the function to call on the smart contract
		method: "function mintTo(address to, string uri)",
		// The function params can be async
		params: async () => {
			// Upload the metadata to IPFS
			const tokenURI = (await upload({
				client: options.contract.client,
				files: [options.nft],
			})[0]) as string;
			// return the contract params
			return [options.to, tokenURI] as const;
		},
	});
}
```
