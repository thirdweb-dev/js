# Extensions

## What are extensions?

Extensions are the most convenient way to interact with contracts and protocols.

They are precompiled, type-safe and highly optimized implementations of common standards such as ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155, etc. They can be handwritten to provide an easier API, sometimes combining multiple contract calls into one convenient function. They can also be generated from any deployed contract using a [simple CLI command](/typescript/v5/extensions/generate).
