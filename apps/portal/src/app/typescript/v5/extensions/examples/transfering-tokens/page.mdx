# Transferring (sending) tokens using thirdweb extensions

## ERC721
```typescript
import { safeTransferFrom } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const transaction = safeTransferFrom({
	contract, // the erc721 contract
	from: "0x-wallet-address-of-owner",
	to: "0x-recipient-address",
	tokenId: 0n, // bigint - if you want to transfer tokenId #0, enter `0n`
});

const transactionReceipt = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({
	account, // the account initiating the transaction
	transaction
});
```

## ERC1155
ERC1155 works in a similar way. However you must specify the quantity that you want to transfer, and an optional data parameter.

```ts
import { safeTransferFrom } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc1155";
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const quantity = 1n;
const optionalData = "0x";

const transaction = safeTransferFrom({
	contract, // the erc1155 contract
	from: "0x...", // owner's wallet address
	to: "0x...", // recipient address
	tokenId: 0n,
	value: quantity,
	data: optionalData,
});

const transactionReceipt = await sendAndConfirmTransaction({
	account, // the account initiating the transaction
	transaction
});
```

## ERC20
```ts
import { transferFrom } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc20";
import { sendAndConfirmTransaction } from "thirdweb";

const transaction = transferFrom({
	contract, // the erc20 contract
	from: "0x...", // owner's wallet address
	to: "0x...", // recipient address
  amount: 10n, // sending 10 tokens
  // Alternatively, you can use `amountWei` if you prefer to use the value in wei
  // amountWei: 10000000000000000000n, // assuming a decimals of 18
});
```
