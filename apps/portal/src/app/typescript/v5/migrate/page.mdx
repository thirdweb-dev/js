## Why you should migrate to SDK v5

#### 1. Better performance, happier clients
The new SDK is built with performance in mind and proper tree-shaking. Therefore, the minimum bundle size of your application is greatly reduced.

Below is the comparison of 2 similar applications, using `ConnectWallet` (v4) & `ConnectButton` (v5), which are identical in term of functionality.

|                     | SDK v4 | SDK v5
| ------------------- | ------ | -------
| Minimum bundle size | <span style={{color: 'red'}}>766kb</span>  | <span style={{color: 'green'}}>104kb</span>
| Dependencies        | `"@thirdweb-dev/react": "^4.9.4"`<br/>`"@thirdweb-dev/sdk": "^4.0.99"`<br/>`"ethers": "^5.7.2"`| `"thirdweb": "^5.42.0"`

_(Built with Next.js 14.2.5)_

#### 2. More wallets supported
The SDK v4 only supports a handful of web3 wallets and the more wallets you want to include in your app, the heavier it becomes.

SDK v5 supports over 300 wallets and this number is increasing! You can [interact with wallets based on their unique IDs](/typescript/v5/wallets#example-connect-a-wallet-and-access-an-account-to-send-a-transaction).
Hence, adding more wallets to your app has little to no effect to the final bundle.

#### 3. Flexibility with React hooks
When building a React web3 application with thirdweb SDK v4, you have access to a set of prebuilt React hooks which let you conveniently interact with your smart contracts.

The issue with this approach is that, the number of smart-contract methods is ever-increasing, and for each hook that does not exist, we have to dedicate time & energy
to write, test & maintain. This process is time-consuming & frankly, the more React hooks you add to your app, the slower and more unmaintainable your projects become.

In SDK v5, we introduce a novel concept called "prebuilt extensions" - a set of read & write methods for popular contracts which you can _plug & play_. For example:
###### Read contract states with v5
```ts
// Get a list of owned ERC721 tokens in a wallet
import { useReadContract } from "thirdweb/react";
import { getOwnedNFTs } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const { data } = useReadContract(getOwned, { contract, owner });
```

###### Write to contract with v5
```ts
// Claim an NFT from thirdweb Drop contract
import { useSendTransaction } from "thirdweb/react";
import { claimTo } from "thirdweb/extensions/erc721";

const { mutate: sendTx } = useSendTransaction();
const transaction = claimTo({
  contract,
  to: "0x...",
  quantity: 1n,
});
sendTx(transaction);
```

As you can see, by pairing the contract extensions with `useReadContract` (for read) and `useSendTransaction` (for write),
we are able to greatly reduce the amount of code that is packaged & shipped to the end users. Plus, with this approach we can dedicate more time
to building contract extensions. The SDK v5 currenty supports over hundreds of extensions, with some popular protocols like Uniswap, Farcaster, Lens & more to come.

#### 4. Access to latest software
Currently the SDK v4 is using `ethers@5.7.2` and `@tanstack/react-query@^4` which can be considered "outdated".
We unfortunately do not have a plan to upgrade v4's dependencies to the latest versions. 
We highly recommend you to migrate to the SDK v5 to receive the latest software with better security and performance.  
Want to keep using ethers.js 5? Worry not! The SDK v5 comes with powerful adapters which let you use thirdweb with popular web3 frameworks like viem or ethers 5 & 6.

## High-level changes

- All imports from `@thirdweb-dev/*` should be replaced with `thirdweb` SDK with sub-exports.
- The new SDK is `function` based rather than `class` based for better tree shaking and performance.
- All contract calls are now prepared using `prepareContractCall` and sent using the `sendTransaction` function.
- Transactions are submitted without waiting for receipt by default. You can call the `waitForReceipt` function to wait for the transaction to be mined.

## Progressive migration

If you're currently using the `@thirdweb-dev/sdk`, you can progressively migrate to the new `thirdweb` SDK. Both SDKs can be used side by side and are interoperable with each other.

You can easily share the same wallet between the two SDKs by using the `ethers5adapter` utility, allowing you to progressively replace calls one by one.

```ts
import { ThirdwebSDK } from "@thirdweb-dev/sdk";
import { prepareContractCall, sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";
import { ethers5Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers5";

const sdk = ThirdwebSDK.fromPrivateKey(pkey, chain);

// convert the signer to be used with the new thirdweb SDK
const account = await ethers5Adapter.signer.fromEthers(sdk.getSigner());

// then use the new thirdweb SDK normally
const transaction = prepareContractCall({ ... });
await sendTransaction({
	transaction,
	account,
});
```

In React, you can mix and match the v4 and v5 `ThirdwebProvider`, that gives you access to the hooks and functionality of both SDKs.

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider} from "@thirdweb-dev/react" }
import { ThirdwebProvider as ThirdwebProviderV5 } from "thirdweb/react"

<ThirdwebProvider activeChain={...} clientId={...}>
  <ThirdwebProviderV5>
     ...
  </ThirdwebProviderV5>
</V4TWProvider>
```

From there, you can obtain the current signer using the `useSigner` hook, and convert it when needed using the `ethers5Adapter`:

```tsx
import { useSigner } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
import { ethers5Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers5";

const signer = useSigner();

const onClick = async () => {
    // convert the signer to used with the new SDK
	const account = await ethers5Adapter.signer.fromEthers(signer);
    // then use the new SDK normally
    const transaction = prepareContractCall({ ... });
    await sendTransaction({
	    transaction,
	    account,
    });
};
```
