# Adapters

The thirdweb SDK can work side by side with:

- ethers.js v5
- ethers.js v6
- viem
- older versions of the @thirdweb-dev/sdk (using the ethers.js v5 adapter)

Adapters allow you to use contracts, providers and wallets from these libraries with the thirdweb SDK and vice versa.

## Ethers v6

You can use an existing ethers.js v6 Signer with the thirdweb SDK by converting it using the `ethers6Adapter`:

```ts
import { ethers6Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers6";
import { sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";

// convert a ethers signer
const signer: ethers.Signer = ...;
const account = await ethers6Adapter.signer.fromEthers({
  signer,
});

// use it with the thirdweb SDK
await sendTransaction({
  transaction,
  account,
});
```

Similarly, you can use any wallets created with the thirdweb SDK with ethers.js v6 by converting them using the `ethers6Adapter`:

```ts
import { ethers6Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers6";
import { createThirdwebClient, inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });
const wallet = inAppWallet();
const chain = sepolia;
const account = await wallet.connect({
	client,
	strategy: "google",
});

// convert a thirdweb account to ethers signer
const ethersSigner = await ethers6Adapter.signer.toEthers({
	client,
	chain,
	account,
});
```

You can also convert ethers.js providers and contracts from and to the thirdweb SDK.

View the [ethers6Adapter](/references/typescript/v5/ethers6Adapter) reference for more details.

## Ethers v5

You can use an existing ethers.js v5 Signer with the thirdweb SDK by converting it using the `ethers5Adapter`:

```ts
import { ethers5Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers5";

// convert an ethers signer to a thirdweb account
const signer: ethers.Signer = ...;
const account = await ethers5Adapter.signer.fromEthers({
  signer,
});

// convert a thirdweb account to ethers signer
const ethersSigner = await ethers5Adapter.signer.toEthers({
  client,
  chain,
  account
});
```

You can also convert ethers.js providers and contracts from and to the thirdweb SDK.

View the [ethers5Adapter](/references/typescript/v5/ethers5Adapter) reference for more details.

## viem

You can use an existing wallet client from viem with the thirdweb SDK by converting it using the `viemAdapter`:

```ts
import { viemAdapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/viem";

// convert a viem wallet client to a thirdweb account
const walletClient = createWalletClient(...);
const account = await viemAdapter.walletClient.fromViem({
  walletClient,
});


// convert a thirdweb account to viem wallet client
const viemClientWallet = viemAdapter.walletClient.toViem({
  client,
  chain,
  account,
});
```

You can also convert viem public clients and contracts from and to the thirdweb SDK.
