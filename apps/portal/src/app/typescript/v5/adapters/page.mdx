# Adapters

The thirdweb SDK can work side by side with:

- wagmi
- ethers.js v5
- ethers.js v6
- viem
- older versions of the @thirdweb-dev/sdk (using the ethers.js v5 adapter)

Adapters allow you to use contracts, providers and wallets from these libraries with the thirdweb SDK and vice versa.

## Wagmi

You can use the thirdweb SDK within a wagmi application by setting the wagmi connected account as the thirdweb 'active wallet'. After that, you can use all of the react components and hooks normally, including `PayEmbed`, `TransactionButton`, etc.

```ts
// Assumes you've wrapped your application in a `<ThirdwebProvider>`

import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { defineChain } from 'thirdweb'
import { useSetActiveWallet } from 'thirdweb/react'
import { createWalletAdapter } from 'thirdweb/wallets'
import { useDisconnect, useSwitchChain, useWalletClient } from 'wagmi'
import { viemAdapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/viem";
import { client } from './client'


const { data: walletClient } = useWalletClient(); // from wagmi 
const { disconnectAsync } = useDisconnect(); // from wagmi
const { switchChainAsync } = useSwitchChain(); // from wagmi
const setActiveWallet = useSetActiveWallet(); // from thirdweb/react
useEffect(() => {
    const setActive = async () => {
        if (walletClient) {
            // adapt the walletClient to a thirdweb account
            const adaptedAccount = viemAdapter.walletClient.fromViem({
                walletClient: walletClient as any, // accounts for wagmi/viem version mismatches
            });
            // create the thirdweb wallet with the adapted account
            const thirdwebWallet = createWalletAdapter({
		client,
                adaptedAccount,
                chain: defineChain(await walletClient.getChainId()),
                onDisconnect: async () => {
                    await disconnectAsync();
                },
                switchChain: async (chain) => {
                    await switchChainAsync({ chainId: chain.id as any });
                },
            });
            setActiveWallet(thirdwebWallet);
        }
    };
    setActive();
}, [walletClient]);

```

You can view a fully functioning wagmi + thirdweb app in this [github repository](https://github.com/thirdweb-example/wagmi-thirdweb-pay).

## Ethers v6

You can use an existing ethers.js v6 Signer with the thirdweb SDK by converting it using the `ethers6Adapter`:

```ts
import { ethers6Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers6";
import { sendTransaction } from "thirdweb";

// convert a ethers signer
const signer: ethers.Signer = ...;
const account = await ethers6Adapter.signer.fromEthers({
  signer,
});

// use it with the thirdweb SDK
await sendTransaction({
  transaction,
  account,
});
```

Similarly, you can use any wallets created with the thirdweb SDK with ethers.js v6 by converting them using the `ethers6Adapter`:

```ts
import { ethers6Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers6";
import { createThirdwebClient, inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";
import { sepolia } from "thirdweb/chains";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });
const wallet = inAppWallet();
const chain = sepolia;
const account = await wallet.connect({
	client,
	strategy: "google",
});

// convert a thirdweb account to ethers signer
const ethersSigner = await ethers6Adapter.signer.toEthers({
	client,
	chain,
	account,
});
```

You can also convert ethers.js providers and contracts from and to the thirdweb SDK.

View the [ethers6Adapter](/references/typescript/v5/ethers6Adapter) reference for more details.

## Ethers v5

You can use an existing ethers.js v5 Signer with the thirdweb SDK by converting it using the `ethers5Adapter`:

```ts
import { ethers5Adapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/ethers5";

// convert an ethers signer to a thirdweb account
const signer: ethers.Signer = ...;
const account = await ethers5Adapter.signer.fromEthers({
  signer,
});

// convert a thirdweb account to ethers signer
const ethersSigner = await ethers5Adapter.signer.toEthers({
  client,
  chain,
  account
});
```

You can also convert ethers.js providers and contracts from and to the thirdweb SDK.

View the [ethers5Adapter](/references/typescript/v5/ethers5Adapter) reference for more details.

## viem

You can use an existing wallet client from viem with the thirdweb SDK by converting it using the `viemAdapter`:

```ts
import { viemAdapter } from "thirdweb/adapters/viem";

// convert a viem wallet client to a thirdweb account
const walletClient = createWalletClient(...);
const account = await viemAdapter.walletClient.fromViem({
  walletClient,
});


// convert a thirdweb account to viem wallet client
const viemClientWallet = viemAdapter.walletClient.toViem({
  client,
  chain,
  account,
});
```

You can also convert viem public clients and contracts from and to the thirdweb SDK.

View the [viemAdapter](/references/typescript/v5/viemAdapter) reference for more details.
