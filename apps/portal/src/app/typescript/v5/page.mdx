## Features

- **React and React Native UI Components**: for wallets connection, transactions and more
- **In-app wallets**: first-class support for email and social logins
- **Account abstraction**: first-class support for ERC4337 smart accounts
- **Type safe contract API**: fully typed with human readable ABI
- **Code generation**: CLI to generate highly optimized contract, type-safe interfaces\
- **RPC for any EVM chain**: highly performant RPCs with just a chain id
- **IPFS upload/download**: simple and efficient IPFS integration
- **Auto ABI resolution**: resolve ABIs for any deployed contract with just an address
- **Ethers / Viem Interoperability**: adapters for ethers and viem libraries

## Design principles

- **Single package:** for Node, React and React Native with tree shaking for a minimal footprint.
- **Performance optimized:** focuses on speed and efficiency with single responsibility principles.
- **Out-of-the-box infra:** direct access to all the thirdweb infrastructure from wallets to RPCs to IPFS.
- **Developer experience:** type-safe, simple to use, with repeatable and predictable patterns.
- **Interoperable:** works with any infra provider and with other libraries like viem and ethers.
