# Interacting with a Modular Contract

There are core contracts for ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 standards. Those follow the standard ERCs and can be interacted with like usual with the standard extensions.

The interesting part is to interact with an attached module. This is done by using the defined module name spaced API for that module.

```ts
import { ClaimableERC721 } from "thirdweb/modules";

const transaction = ClaimableERC721.mint({
 contract,
 to: "0x...", // Address to mint tokens to
 quantity: 2, // Amount of tokens to mint
});

// Send the transaction
await sendTransaction({ transaction, account });
```

You can view all the prebuilt modules available in the [modules reference](/references/typescript/v5/functions#modules-1).
