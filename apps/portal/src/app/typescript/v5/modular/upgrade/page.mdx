# Upgrading a Modular Contract

### Installing a new module

These modules can be swapped at any time, and new ones can also be added post deployment. Here's how to install a new module.

```ts
import {
  RoyaltyERC721,
} from "thirdweb/modules";

const transaction = RoyaltyERC721.install({
  contract: coreContract,
  account,
  params: {
     royaltyRecipient: account.address,
     royaltyBps: 100n,
     transferValidator: ZERO_ADDRESS,
  },
});
```

The `install` function is available on all modules, organized by module name space.

You can also use the standalone [`installPublishedModule`](/typescript/v5/common/installPublishedModule) function to install custom modules.
