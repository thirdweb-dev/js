# In-App Wallets

Create in-app wallet for your users based on their email, phone, passkey, social auth or even their external wallets. These wallets are scoped by your clientId and do not require any confirmation to sign transactions. 

## Available auth methods

## Configure in-app wallets

The simplest way to create an in-app wallet is to use the `inAppWallet()` function. By default, this will create a wallet that supports email/password login, Google, Apple, Facebook login, and passkey.

```tsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = inAppWallet();
```

You can also customize the wallet by passing in options.

```tsx
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const wallet = inAppWallet({
	auth: {
        mode, // options are "popup" | "redirect" | "window";
        options, // ex: ["discord", "farcaster", "apple", "facebook", "google", "passkey"],
        passkeyDomain, // for passkey, the domain that the passkey is created on
        redirectUrl, // the URL to redirect to after authentication
	},
	metadata, // metadata for the wallet (name, icon, etc.)
	smartAccount, // smart account options for the wallet (for gasless tx)
});
```

Once created, you can use it either with the prebuilt UI components, or with your own UI.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ThirdwebProvider, ConnectButton } from "thirdweb/react";
import { inAppWallet } from "thirdweb/wallets";

const client = createThirdwebClient({ clientId });
const wallet = inAppWallet();

const account = await wallet.connect({
	client,
	strategy: "google",
});

console.log("connected as", account.address);

```
