# Client

A client is the entry point to the thirdweb SDK. It is required for all other actions.

<Callout title="Client ID" variant="info">

    You must provide a `clientId` or `secretKey` in order to initialize a client.

    You can create a client ID for free at
    [thirdweb.com/create-api-key](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).

</Callout>

## Create a client

#### For "client-side" usage

```ts
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
	clientId: "<your_client_id>",
});
```

#### For "server-side" usage

```ts
import { createThirdwebClient } from "thirdweb";

const client = createThirdwebClient({
	secretKey: "<your_secret_key>",
});
```

You will need to pass this client to other methods in the SDK. This will allow you to

- get performant RPC to all chains
- download/upload to IPFS
- access Account Abstraction infrastructure (bundler, paymaster)
- access other thirdweb services

<Callout variant="info" title="Getting your RPC URL">
	If you need to access the raw RPC URL, just use thirdweb's default RPC format with your client ID `https://<chainId>.rpc.thirdweb.com/<clientId>`.
</Callout>
