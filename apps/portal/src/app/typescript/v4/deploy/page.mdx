# Deploying contracts

export const metadata = createMetadata({
	image: {
		title: "Deploying contracts",
		icon: "typescript",
	},
	title: "Deploying contracts | thirdweb TypeScript SDK",
	description: "Deploying contracts with the thirdweb TypeScript SDK",
});

To deploy contracts, you will first need to instantiate the SDK with a valid signer.

```ts
const sdk = await ThirdwebSDK.fromWallet(wallet, "sepolia");
const address = await sdk.deployer.deployBuiltInContract("nft-collection", {
	name: "My NFT Contract",
	primary_sale_recipient: "0x...",
});
console.log("Deployed at", address);
```

## Deploy methods

You can then use the [`sdk.deployer`](/references/typescript/v4/ContractDeployer) object to deploy different kind of contracts.
