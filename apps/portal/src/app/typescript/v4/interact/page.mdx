# Interacting With Contracts

After initializing the SDK on a given chain, you can obtain instances of a target contract by their address, read state from it and execute transactions on it on behalf of the connected wallet.

<Heading
	id="contract-instance"
	level={2}
	children="Getting a Contract Instance"
/>

To get a contract instance, you only need the contract's address. The contract ABI will be automatically resolved from the onchain contract metadata.

```ts
const sdk = new ThirdwebSDK("sepolia");
const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...");
```

You can still optionally specify the ABI as a second argument to skip the automatic resolution.

```ts
const ABI = [...];
const contract = await sdk.getContract("0x...", ABI);
```

This will return an instance of [`SmartContract`](/references/typescript/v4/SmartContract) which you can use to interact with the contract.

<Heading id="read" level={2} children="Reading State" />

Calling generic `view` functions on your contract can be done via the [`call`](/references/typescript/v4/SmartContract#call) function. The return type will match the return type of the contract function.

```ts
const result = await contract.call("myViewFunction", [arg1, arg2]);
```

<Heading id="write" level={2} children="Executing Transactions" />

Executing transactions on your contract can also be done via the [`call`](/references/typescript/v4/SmartContract#call) function. The return type will always be a `TransactionResult` containing the transaction receipt.

By default, this will wait till the transaction is fully mined onchain.

```ts
const result = await contract.call("myTransactionFunction", [arg1, arg2]);
console.log("Executed transaction:", result.receipt.transationHash);
```

You can also optionally specify transaction overrides as the third argument.

```ts
const result = await contract.call("myTransactionFunction", [arg1, arg2], {
    value: toWei(0.1),
	gasLimit: 1000000,
	nonce: 0,
    ...
});
```

<Callout variant="info" title='Handling transaction errors'>

Every write transaction in the SDK will throw an error of type [`TransactionError`](/references/typescript/v4/TransactionError) if the execution fails for any reason.

You can show heplful error messages to your users by checking the `reason` property of the error.

```ts
try {
	await contract.call("myTransactionFunction", [arg1, arg2]);
} catch (e) {
	const errorReason = (e as TransactionError)?.reason;
	console.log("Execution reverted with reason:", reason);
}
```

</Callout>

<Heading id="prepare" level={2} children="Preparing Transactions" />

You can also prepare a transaction without executing it. This will return a [`Transaction`](/references/typescript/v4/Transaction) object that you can use to estimate, simulate, sign, send and execute the transaction yourself.

```ts
const tx = await contract.prepare("myTransactionFunction", [arg1, arg2]);

const encoded = await tx.encode(); // Encode the transaction
const gasCost = await tx.estimateGasCost(); // Estimate the gas cost
const simulatedTx = await tx.simulate(); // Simulate the transaction
const signedTx = await tx.sign(); // Sign the transaction for later use

// Submit the transaction, but don't wait for confirmations
const sentTx = await tx.send();
console.log("Submitted transaction:", sentTx.hash);
```

<Heading id="events" level={2} children="Listening to Events" />

You can retrieve and listen to events emitted by your contract by using the [`contract.events`](/references/typescript/v4/ContractEvents) namespace.

Here's how to get past events emitted by your contract. Note that passing a block range is highly recommended.

```ts
// Optionally pass in filters to limit the blocks from which events are retrieved
const filters = {
	fromBlock: -2000,
	toBlock: "latest",
};
// get All events
const events = await contract.events.getAllEvents(filters);
console.log(events[0].eventName);
console.log(events[0].data);

// or get a particular event type
const events = await contract.events.getEvents("Transfer", filters);
console.log(events[0].eventName);
console.log(events[0].data);
```

And how to listen to new events emitted by your contract in real time:

```ts
contract.events.listenToAllEvents((event) => {
  console.log(event.eventName) // the name of the emitted event
  console.log(event.data) // event payload
}

// or listen to a particular event type
contract.events.addEventListener("Transfer", (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```
