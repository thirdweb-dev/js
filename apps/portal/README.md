## How to Contribute

### GitHub Workflow

If you're new to GitHub, we recommend reading the [GitHub Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) to learn how to fork a repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request.

### Review Process

Once you've submitted your contribution, One of the thirdweb Developer will review your changes, provide feedback, and merge the pull request when it's ready.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need further assistance in your PR's comments.

Thank you for contributing to the thirdweb docs and being a part of our community!

### Writing MDX

The docs are written in MDX, a markdown format that supports JSX syntax. This allows us to embed React components in the docs. See the GitHub Markdown Guide for a quick overview of markdown syntax.

We have a collection of Components that you can import and use in your MDX files. See the [Styleguide](https://docs-v2.thirdweb-preview.com/styleguide) page to see output of all the components. You can see the source code for those components in the `src/app/styleguide/` folder

### Installation

We use `pnpm` and `bun`. Make sure you have them installed on your machine to run the project locally.

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Start local development server

```bash
pnpm dev
```
