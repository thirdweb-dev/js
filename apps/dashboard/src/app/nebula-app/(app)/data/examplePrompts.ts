### Understand
Retrieve information about smart contracts.
- What ERC standards are implemented by contract address 0x59325733eb952a92e069C87F0A6168b29E80627f on Ethereum?
- What functions can I use to mint more of my contract's NFTs?

- How much ETH is in my wallet?
- What is the wallet address of vitalik.eth?
- Does my wallet hold USDC on Base?

### Explore
Access blockchain-specific data.
- What is the last block on zkSync?
- What is the current gas price on Avalanche C-Chain?
- Can you show me transaction details for 0xdfc450bb39e44bd37c22e0bfd0e5212edbea571e4e534d87b5cbbf06f10b9e04 on Optimism?

### Research

Let's create your token! Just name it and I'll get started. I'll take care of the rest.

Add more info for more fun:
- Symbol (e.g. 'HELLO')
- Description (e.g. 'Hello world token deployed by Nebula')
- Total Supply (e.g. 1 million)
- Mint total supply to your wallet (default is true)
- Decimal places (default 18)
- Image URL

If you want, I can generate an image for it too.

const buyUsdcReply = `
Easy. How much USDC?
You can pay with any token, but I'll default to ETH.

const transferEthReply = `
Great! How much ETH and to what address?
