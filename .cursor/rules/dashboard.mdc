# Reusable Core UI Components

- Always import from the central UI library under `@/components/ui/*` – e.g. `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`.
- Prefer composable primitives over custom markup: `Button`, `Input`, `Select`, `Tabs`, `Card`, `Sidebar`, `Separator`, `Badge`.
- Use `NavLink` (`@/components/ui/NavLink`) for internal navigation so active states are handled automatically.
- Layouts should reuse `SidebarLayout` / `FullWidthSidebarLayout` (`@/components/blocks/SidebarLayout`).
- For notices & skeletons rely on `AnnouncementBanner`, `GenericLoadingPage`, `EmptyStateCard`.
- Icons come from `lucide-react` or the project-specific `…/icons` exports – never embed raw SVG.
- Group related components in their own folder and expose a single barrel `index.ts` where necessary.
- Keep components pure; fetch data outside (server component or hook) and pass it down via props.

# Styling

- Tailwind CSS is **the** styling system – avoid inline styles or CSS modules.
- Merge class names with `cn` from `@/lib/utils` to keep conditional logic readable.
- Stick to design-tokens: background (`bg-card`), borders (`border-border`), muted text (`text-muted-foreground`) etc.
- Use the `container` class with a `max-w-7xl` cap for page width consistency.
- Spacing utilities (`px-*`, `py-*`, `gap-*`) are preferred over custom margins.
- Responsive helpers follow mobile-first (`max-sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`).
- Never hard-code colors – always go through Tailwind variables.
- Add `className` to the root element of every component for external overrides.

# Creating a new Component

- Place the file close to its feature: `feature/components/MyComponent.tsx`.
- Name files after the component in **PascalCase**; append `.client.tsx` when interactive.
- Client components must start with `'use client';` before imports.
- Accept a typed `props` object and export a **named** function (`export function MyComponent()`).
- Reuse core UI primitives; avoid re-implementing buttons, cards, modals.
- Combine class names via `cn`, expose `className` prop if useful.
- Local state or effects live inside; data fetching happens in hooks.
- Provide a Storybook story (`MyComponent.stories.tsx`) or unit test alongside the component.

# When to use Server Side Rendering (Server Components)

- Reading cookies/headers with `next/headers` (`getAuthToken()`, `cookies()`).
- Accessing server-only environment variables or secrets.
- Heavy data fetching that should not ship to the client (e.g. analytics, billing).
- Redirect logic using `redirect()` from `next/navigation`.
- Building layout shells (`layout.tsx`) and top-level pages that mainly assemble data.
- Export default async functions without `'use client';` – they run on the Node edge.
- Co-locate data helpers under `@/api/**` and mark them with `"server-only"`.

# When to use Client Side Rendering (Client Components)

- Interactive UI that relies on hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, React Query, wallet hooks).
- Components that listen to user events, animations or live updates.
- When you need access to browser APIs (localStorage, window, IntersectionObserver etc.).
- Pages requiring fast transitions where data is prefetched on the client.
- Anything that consumes hooks from `@tanstack/react-query` or thirdweb SDKs.

# Fetching Authenticated Data – Server

```ts
import "server-only";
import { API_SERVER_URL } from "@/constants/env";
import { getAuthToken } from "@/app/(app)/api/lib/getAuthToken";

export async function getProjects(teamSlug: string) {
  const token = await getAuthToken();
  if (!token) return [];
  const res = await fetch(`${API_SERVER_URL}/v1/teams/${teamSlug}/projects`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` },
  });
  return res.ok ? (await res.json()).result : [];
}
```

Guidelines:

- Always call `getAuthToken()` to get the JWT from cookies.
- Prefix files with `import "server-only";` so they never end up in the client bundle.
- Pass the token in the `Authorization: Bearer` header – never embed it in the URL.
- Return typed results (`Project[]`, `User[]`, …) – avoid `any`.

# Fetching Authenticated Data – Client

```ts
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { fetchJson } from "@/lib/fetch-json";

export function useProjects(teamSlug: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["projects", teamSlug],
    queryFn: () => fetchJson(`/api/projects?team=${teamSlug}`), // internal API route handles token
    staleTime: 60_000,
  });
}
```

Guidelines:

- Use **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) for all client data fetching.
- Create light wrappers (e.g. `fetchJson`) that automatically attach the JWT from cookies/session when calling internal API routes.
- Keep `queryKey` stable and descriptive for cache hits.
- Prefer API routes or server actions to keep tokens secret; the browser only sees relative paths.
- Configure `staleTime` / `cacheTime` according to freshness requirements.

# Analytics Event Reporting

- **Add events intentionally** – only when they answer a concrete product/business question.
- **Event name**: human-readable `<subject> <verb>` phrase (e.g. `"contract deployed"`).
- **Reporting helper**: `report<Subject><Verb>` (PascalCase); all live in `src/@/analytics/report.ts`.
- **Mandatory JSDoc**: explain *Why* the event exists and *Who* owns it (`@username`).
- **Typed properties**: accept a single `properties` object and pass it unchanged to `posthog.capture`.
- **Client-side only**: never import `posthog-js` in server components.
- **Housekeeping**: ping **#core-services** before renaming or removing an event.

```ts
/**
 * ### Why do we need to report this event?
 * - Tracks number of contracts deployed
 *
 * ### Who is responsible for this event?
 * @jnsdls
 */
export function reportContractDeployed(properties: {
  address: string;
  chainId: number;
}) {
  posthog.capture("contract deployed", properties);
}
```
