/**
 * Get a quote of type [`BuyWithFiatQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/BuyWithFiatQuote) to buy given token with fiat currency.
 * This quote contains the information about the swap such as token amounts, processing fees, estimated time etc.
 *
 * ### Rendering the On-Ramp provider UI
 * Once you have the `quote`, you can open the `quote.onRampLink` in a new tab - This will prompt the user to buy the token with fiat currency
 *
 * ### Determining the steps required
 * If `quote.onRampToken.token` is same as `quote.toToken` ( same chain + same token address ) - This means that the token can be directly bought from the on-ramp provider.
 * But if they are different, On-ramp provider will send the `quote.onRampToken` to the user's wallet address and a swap is required to swap it to the desired token onchain.
 *
 * You can use the [`isSwapRequiredPostOnramp`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/isSwapRequiredPostOnramp) utility function to check if a swap is required after the on-ramp is done.
 *
 * ### Polling for the status
 * Once you open the `quote.onRampLink` in a new tab, you can start polling for the status using [`getBuyWithFiatStatus`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getBuyWithFiatStatus) to get the status of the transaction.
 *
 * `getBuyWithFiatStatus` returns a status object of type [`BuyWithFiatStatus`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/BuyWithFiatStatus).
 *
 * - If no swap is required - the status will become `"ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_COMPLETED"` once the on-ramp provider has sent the desired token to the user's wallet address. Once you receive this status, the process is complete.
 * - If a swap is required - the status will become `"CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED"` once the on-ramp provider has sent the tokens to the user's wallet address. Once you receive this status, you need to start the swap process.
 *
 * ### Swap Process
 * On receiving the `"CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED"` status, you can use the [`getPostOnRampQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getPostOnRampQuote) function to get the quote for the swap of type [`BuyWithCryptoQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/BuyWithCryptoQuote).
 *
 * Once you have this quote - You can follow the same steps as mentioned in the [`getBuyWithCryptoQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getBuyWithCryptoQuote) documentation to perform the swap.
 *
 * @param params - object of type [`GetBuyWithFiatQuoteParams`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/GetBuyWithFiatQuoteParams)
 * @returns Object of type [`BuyWithFiatQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/BuyWithFiatQuote) which contains the information about the quote such as processing fees, estimated time, converted token amounts, etc.
 * @example
 * Get a quote for buying 10 USDC on polygon chain (chainId: 137) with USD fiat currency:
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { getBuyWithFiatQuote } from "thirdweb/pay";
 *
 * const quote = await getBuyWithFiatQuote({
 *  client: client, // thirdweb client
 *  fromCurrencySymbol: "USD", // fiat currency symbol
 *  toChainId: 137, // polygon chain id
 *  toAmount: "10", // amount of USDC to buy
 *  toTokenAddress: "0x3c499c542cEF5E3811e1192ce70d8cC03d5c3359" // USDC token address in polygon chain
 *  toAddress: "0x...", // user's wallet address
 *  isTestMode: false, // whether to use onramp in test mode for testing purpose (defaults to false)
 * });
