/**
 * Once you get a `quote` from [`getBuyWithFiatQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getBuyWithFiatQuote)
 * and open the `quote.onRampLink` in a new tab, you can start polling for the transaction status using `getBuyWithFiatStatus`
 *
 * You should keep calling this function at regular intervals while the status is in one of the pending states such as - "PENDING_PAYMENT", "PENDING_ON_RAMP_TRANSFER", "ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_IN_PROGRESS", "CRYPTO_SWAP_IN_PROGRESS" etc..
 *
 * If `quote.onRampToken` is same as `quote.toToken` (same chain + same token address) - This means that the token can be directly bought from the on-ramp provider.
 * But if they are different - On-ramp provider will send the `quote.onRampToken` to the user's wallet address and a swap is required to convert it to the desired token.
 * You can use the [`isSwapRequiredPostOnramp`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/isSwapRequiredPostOnramp) utility function to check if a swap is required after the on-ramp is done.
 *
 * #### When no swap is required
 * If there is no swap required - the status will become `"ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_COMPLETED"` once the on-ramp provider has sent the tokens to the user's wallet address.
 * Once you receive this status, the process is complete.
 *
 * ### When a swap is required
 * If a swap is required - the status will become `"CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED"` once the on-ramp provider has sent the tokens to the user's wallet address.
 * Once you receive this status, you need to start the swap process.
 *
 * On receiving the `"CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED"` status, you can use the [`getPostOnRampQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getPostOnRampQuote) function to get the quote for the swap of type [`BuyWithCryptoQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/BuyWithCryptoQuote).
 *
 * Once you have this quote - You can follow the same steps as mentioned in the [`getBuyWithCryptoQuote`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/getBuyWithCryptoQuote) documentation to perform the swap.
 *
 * @param params - Object of type [`GetBuyWithFiatStatusParams`](https://portal.thirdweb.com/references/typescript/v5/GetBuyWithFiatStatusParams)
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // step 1 - get a quote
 * const fiatQuote = await getBuyWithFiatQuote(fiatQuoteParams)
 *
 * // step 2 - open the on-ramp provider UI
 * window.open(quote.onRampLink, "_blank");
 *
 * // step 3 - keep calling getBuyWithFiatStatus while the status is in one of the pending states
 * const fiatStatus = await getBuyWithFiatStatus({
 *    client,
 *    intentId: fiatQuote.intentId,
 * })
 *
 * // when the fiatStatus.status is "ON_RAMP_TRANSFER_COMPLETED" - the process is complete
 * // when the fiatStatus.status is "CRYPTO_SWAP_REQUIRED" - start the swap process
 * ```
