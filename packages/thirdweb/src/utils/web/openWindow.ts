    // WebViews where a blank tab is left behind after connecting.
    // This is especially bad in some WebView scenarios (e.g. following a
    // link from Twitter) where the user doesn't have any mechanism for
    // closing the blank tab.

    // from this problem, and programmatically clicking a detached link
    // element with the same attributes also avoids the issue.
