/**
 * Prepares a **finalized** Universal Bridge quote for the provided transfer request with transaction data.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Bridge, NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS } from "thirdweb";
 *
 * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({
 *   chainId: 1,
 *   tokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
 *   amount: toWei("0.01"),

 *   receiver: "0x...",
 *   client: thirdwebClient,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * This will return a quote that might look like:

 *           data: "0x...",
 *           chainId: 1,
 *           type: "eip1559"
 *         }
 *       ]
 *     }
 *   ],
 *   expiration: 1741730936680,
 *   intent: {
 *     chainId: 1,
 *     tokenAddress: "0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE",
 *     amount: 10000000000000000n,
 *     sender: "0x...",
 *     receiver: "0x..."
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Sending the transactions
 * The `transactions` array is a series of [ox](https://oxlib.sh) EIP-1559 transactions that must be executed one after the other in order to fulfill the complete route. There are a few things to keep in mind when executing these transactions:
 *  - Approvals will have the `approval` action specified. You can perform approvals with `sendAndConfirmTransaction`, then proceed to the next transaction.
 *  - All transactions are assumed to be executed by the `sender` address, regardless of which chain they are on. The final transaction will use the `receiver` as the recipient address.
 *  - If an `expiration` timestamp is provided, all transactions must be executed before that time to guarantee successful execution at the specified price.
 *
 * NOTE: To get the status of each non-approval transaction, use `Bridge.status` rather than checking for transaction inclusion. This function will ensure full completion of the transfer.
 *
 * You can access this functions input and output types with `Transfer.prepare.Options` and `Transfer.prepare.Result`, respectively.
 *
 * You can include arbitrary data to be included on any webhooks and status responses with the `purchaseData` option.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({
 *   chainId: 1,
 *   tokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,
 *   amount: toWei("0.01"),
 *   sender: "0x...",
 *   receiver: "0x...",
 *   purchaseData: {
 *     reference: "payment-123",
 *     metadata: {
 *       note: "Transfer to Alice"
 *     }
 *   },
 *   client: thirdwebClient,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Fees
 * There may be fees associated with the transfer. These fees are paid by the `feePayer` address, which defaults to the `sender` address. You can specify a different address with the `feePayer` option. If you do not specify an option or explicitly specify `sender`, the fees will be added to the input amount. If you specify the `receiver` as the fee payer the fees will be subtracted from the destination amount.
 *
 * For example, if you were to request a transfer with `feePayer` set to `receiver`:
 * ```typescript
 * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({
 *   chainId: 1,
 *   tokenAddress: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", // USDC
 *   amount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC
 *   sender: "0x...",
 *   receiver: "0x...",
 *   feePayer: "receiver",
 *   client: thirdwebClient,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The returned quote might look like:
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   originAmount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC
 *   destinationAmount: 99_970_000n, // 99.97 USDC
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * If you were to request a transfer with `feePayer` set to `sender`:
 * ```typescript
 * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({
 *   chainId: 1,
 *   tokenAddress: "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48", // USDC
 *   amount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC
 *   sender: "0x...",
 *   receiver: "0x...",
 *   feePayer: "sender",
 *   client: thirdwebClient,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * The returned quote might look like:
 * ```typescript
 * {
 *   originAmount: 100_030_000n, // 100.03 USDC
 *   destinationAmount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC
 *   ...
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param options - The options for the quote.
 * @param options.chainId - The chain ID of the token.
 * @param options.tokenAddress - The address of the token.
 * @param options.amount - The amount of the token to transfer.
 * @param options.sender - The address of the sender.
 * @param options.receiver - The address of the recipient.
 * @param options.purchaseData - Arbitrary data to be passed to the transfer function and included with any webhooks or status calls.
 * @param options.client - Your thirdweb client.
 * @param [options.feePayer] - The address that will pay the fees for the transfer. If not specified, the sender will be used. Values can be "sender" or "receiver".
 *
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a finalized quote and transactions for the requested transfer.
 *
 * @throws Will throw an error if there is an issue fetching the quote.
