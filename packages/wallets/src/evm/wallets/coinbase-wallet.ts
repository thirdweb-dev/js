   *
   * ### clientId (recommended)
   *
   * Provide `clientId` to use the thirdweb RPCs for given `chains`
   *
   * You can create a client ID for your application from [thirdweb dashboard](https://thirdweb.com/create-api-key).
   *
   *
   * ### chains (optional)
   *
   * Provide an array of chains you want to support.
   *
   * Must be an array of `Chain` objects, from the [`@thirdweb-dev/chains`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/\@thirdweb-dev/chains) package.
   *
   * Defaults to our [default chains](/react/react.thirdwebprovider#default-chains).
   *
   *
   * ### dappMetadata (optional)
   *
   * Information about your app that the wallet will display when your app tries to connect to it.
   *
   * Must be an object containing `name`, `url` and optionally `description` and `logoUrl` properties.
   *
   * ```javascript
   * import { CoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets";
   *
   * const walletWithOptions = new CoinbaseWallet({
   *   dappMetadata: {
   *     name: "thirdweb powered dApp",
   *     url: "https://thirdweb.com",
   *     description: "thirdweb powered dApp", // optional
   *     logoUrl: "https://thirdweb.com/favicon.ico", // optional
   *   },
   * });
   * ```
   *
   * ### headlessMode (optional)
   * This is only relevant applies when coinbase extension wallet is NOT installed on user's browser.
   *
   * By default `headlessMode` is set to `false` - which means that when user does not have coinbase wallet extension installed, a QR Code scan modal will open when calling the `connect` method to allow the user to connect to their coinbase mobile app by scanning the QR code.
   *
   * If headlessMode is set to `true` and coinbase wallet extension is not installed, the wallet will NOT open a QR Code scan modal - This is useful if you want to create a custom QR Code modal.
   *
   * you can use the `getQrUrl` method to get the QR Code url and create your own QR Code Modal
   *
   * Must be a `boolean`.
