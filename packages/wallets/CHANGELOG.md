  #### Breaking changes:

  ### React and React Native

  1. Replaced `walletConnectors` with `supportedWallets` in the ThirdwebProvider.

  ```diff
    import { coinbaseWallet, metamaskWallet, ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

    const App = () => {
    - return <ThirdwebProvider walletConnectors={["metamask", "coinbaseWallet"]}>{...}</ThirdwebProvider>
    + return <ThirdwebProvider supportedWallets={[metamaskWallet(), coinbaseWallet()]}>{...}</ThirdwebProvider>
    }
  ```

  2. `magicLinkConnector` not yet implemented in this version

  3. Removed `desiredChainId`, use `activeChain` instead

  4. `DAppMetaData` type now requires the `url` field to be passed in

  5. Removed `chainRpc` prop from the ThirdwebProvider. You can pass custom rpcs in the Chain object through the `activeChain` and `supportedChains` props.

  6. Replaced the `useNetwork` hook for `useChain` and `useSwitchChain`

  7. Updated `ConnectWallet` button in React:

  - Removed `accentColor` and `colorMode`
  - Added a `theme` prop with `dark` and `light` values

  8. Updated the `Web3Button` button in React:

  - Removed `accentColor` and `colorMode`
  - Added a `theme` prop with `dark` and `light` values

  ### Patch Changes

  - You can now pass a `theme` prop to the ThirdwebProvider. Values are `light` and `dark`

  ```
    import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

    const App = () => {
    return <ThirdwebProvider theme='light'>{...}</ThirdwebProvider>
    }
  ```

  - New wallets package with support for the most common wallets. MetaMask, Coinbase, WalletConnect V1 and V2 and PaperWallet

  - Added `autoSwitch` prop to the ThirdwebProvider to control whether or not to automatically switch to wallet's network to active chain

  ```
    import { ThirdwebProvider } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";

    const App = () => {
    return <ThirdwebProvider autoSwitch>{...}</ThirdwebProvider>
    }
  ```
