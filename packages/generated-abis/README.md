# generated-abis

This package is used as an ABI cache for the CLI and SDK that can get bundled with the SDK. It's used to store generated ABIs that can be used for performance optimization purposes and static types by the SDK. It will never need to be edited or rebuilt.

Instead of using this directly, go to the [thirdweb SDK package](https://npmjs.com/package/@thirdweb-dev/sdk).
