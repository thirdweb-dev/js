  // Pass in domain and wallet to the constructor
  const wallet = new PrivateKeyWallet("0x...");
  const auth = new ThirdwebAuth(wallet, "example.com");

  // Auth functions no longer require domain to be passed in
  const payload = await auth.login();
  ```

  Additionally, `AwsKmsWallet` and `AwsSecretsManager` wallets have been moved into the `@thirdweb-dev/wallets/evm` entrypoint from the SDK.

  ```js
  import {
    AwsKmsWallet,
    AwsSecretsManagerWallet,
  } from "@thirdweb-dev/wallets/evm";

  1. claim conditions had some changes to support the new drop contracts:

  **Behavior change**

  We've made allowlists much more performant using sharded merkle trees. This allows us to process large allowlists (1M+) efficiently.

  To support those large allowlists, fetching claim conditions does not fetch the allowlist data by default anymore. Instead, you can pass an options object to additionally fetch the allowlist data along with the rest of the claim conditions data.

  This affects `ClaimConditions.getActive()` and `ClaimConditions.getAll()`

  Examples:

  ```ts
  const activeClaimCondition =
    await contract.erc721.claimConditions.getActive();
  // `activeClaimCondition.snapshot` is undefined
  const activeclaimConditionWithtAllowList =
    await contract.erc721.claimConditions.getActive({
      withAllowList: true,
    });
  // `activeClaimCondition.snapshot` returns the allowlist data
  ```

  #### NFT Types are now consistent accross EVM (both ERC721 and ERC1155) and Solana

  This is a transparent upgrade, except for one type change for ERC1155 NFTs

  - nft.id is now of type `string` instead of `BigNumber`
  - edition.supply is now of type `number` instead of `BigNumber`

  This should make it much easer to deal with in applications, instead of having to manipulate BigNumber objects.

  Most people convert BigNumber to strings, which is compatible with this upgrade.

  ## _MAJOR VERSION CHANGE_

  - 85% reduction in package size!
  - Custom contracts are now first class citizens

  [Full changelog](https://blog.thirdweb.com/sdk-major-update/)

  #### Breaking changes:

  1. Getting contracts is now async. This allows dynamically importing contracts and reduces the weight of the SDK significantly.

  before:

  ```javascript
  const token = sdk.getToken(...)
  const nftDrop = sdk.getNFTDrop(...)
  ```

  after:

  ```javascript
  const token = await sdk.getToken(...)
  const nftDrop = await sdk.getNFTDrop(...)
  ```

  2. New Extension API for custom contracts

  When working with custom contracts using `await sdk.getContract(...)`, we now expose all the convenient high level APIs for each ERC standard top level. Calling a function that is not supported in your contract will give you an error with instructions on how to unlock that functionality.

  before:

  ```javascript
  const contract = await sdk.getContract(...)
  // ERC721 contracts
  const contract.nft?.drop?.claim?.to(...)
  const contract.nft?.drop?.claim?.conditions.set(...)
  // ERC1155 contracts
  const contract.edition?.mint?.to(...)
  // ERC20 contracts
  const contract.token?.burn.tokens(...)
  ```

  after:

  ```javascript
  const contract = await sdk.getContract(...)
  // ERC721 contracts
  const contract.erc721.claimTo(...)
  const contract.erc721.claimConditions.set(...)
  // ERC1155 contracts
  const contract.erc1155.mintTo(...)
  // ERC20 contracts
  const contract.erc20.burn(...)
  ```
