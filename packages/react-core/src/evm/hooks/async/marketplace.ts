/**
 * Hook for getting a specific listing on a `Marketplace` contract.
 *
 * __This hook is only available for `Marketplace` contracts__
 *
 * If you are using [Marketplace V3](https://thirdweb.com/thirdweb.eth/MarketplaceV3),
 * use `useDirectListing` or `useEnglishAuction` instead.
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```jsx
 * import { useContract, useListing } from "@thirdweb-dev/react";
 *
 * const listingId = 0;
 *
 * function App() {

 *
 * @example
 * ```javascript

 * function App() {

 * @param listingId -
 * The listing ID of the item that you want to get the bid buffer for.
 * The listing must be an auction (or english auction) listing, the hook will populate the `error` property if it is not.
 *
 * @returns
 * The hook's `data` property, once loaded, returns a `BigNumber` value representing the current bid buffer.
 *
 * The `bidBuffer` value returned is in percentage format.
 * For example, a value of `500` means that the next bid must be 5% higher than the current highest bid.

 * This is because the marketplace needs permission to execute sales and transfer the NFTs to the buyer when a sale is made.
