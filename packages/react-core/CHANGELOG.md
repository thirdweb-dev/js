- [#460](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/pull/460) [`a6c074c`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/commit/a6c074c3f33148cd17f5a66a58df9272a4381bab) Thanks [@adam-maj](https://github.com/adam-maj)! - All Auth hooks and configuration have been upgraded along with the major upgrade to Auth. This includes changes in necessary `authConfig` to the `ThirdwebProvider`, as well as usage of the `useLogin`, `useLogout`, and `useUser` hooks.

  ## How to Upgrade

  In order to upgrade your frontend setup to account for these changes, you'll need to make the following changes to your app:

  **1. Remove `loginRedirect` from `authConfig`**

  In your `ThirdwebProvider`, you can remove the `loginRedirect` option from the `authConfig` object, as the `login` endpoint no longer uses redirects.

  ```jsx
  export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return (
      <ThirdwebProvider
        authConfig={{
          domain: "example.com",
          authUrl: "/api/auth",
          // No more loginRedirect
        }}
      >
        <Component {...pageProps} />
      </ThirdwebProvider>
    );
  }
  ```

  **2. Update `useLogin` and `useLogout` to use object destructuring**

  The `useLogin` and `useLogout` hooks now return an object with a `login` and `logout` function (as well as `isLoading` states), respectively. You'll need to update your usage of these hooks to use object destructuring.

  ```jsx
  import { useLogin, useLogout } from "@thirdweb-dev/react-core";

  export default function Component() {
    const { login } = useLogin();
    const { logout } = useLogout();

    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={login}>Login</button>
        <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```
