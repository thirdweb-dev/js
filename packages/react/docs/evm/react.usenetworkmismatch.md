## useNetworkMismatch() function

Hook for checking whether the connected wallet is on the correct network specified by the `desiredChainId` passed to the `<ThirdwebProvider />`<!-- -->.

```javascript
import { useNetworkMistmatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"
```

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare function useNetworkMismatch(): boolean;
```
<b>Returns:</b>

boolean

`true` if the chainId of the connected wallet is different from the desired chainId passed into <ThirdwebProvider />

## Example

You can check if a users wallet is connected to the correct chain ID as follows:

```javascript
import { useNetworkMismatch } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"

const App = () => {
  const isMismatched = useNetworkMismatch()

  return <div>{isMismatched}</div>
}
```
From here, you can prompt users to switch their network using the `useNetwork` hook.
