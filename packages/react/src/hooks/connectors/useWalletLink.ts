 * Hook for connecting to a Coinbase wallet.

 * We can allow users to connect with Coinbase Wallet as follows:
 * ```javascript
 * import { useCoinbaseWallet } from "@thirdweb-dev/react"
 *
 * const App = () => {
 *   const connectWithCoinbaseWallet = useCoinbaseWallet()
 *
 *   return (
 *     <button onClick={connectWithCoinbaseWallet}>
 *       Connect Coinbase Wallet
 *     </button>
 *   )
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Upon clicking this button, users will be prompted with a popup asking them scan a QR code with their Coinbase Wallet.
 * Once they scan the QR code, their wallet will then be connected to the page as expected.
