# @thirdweb-dev/payments

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#1913](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/pull/1913) [`ed3afd41`](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/js/commit/ed3afd418cb6e0d711814a1c52afb302460751ba) Thanks [@IDubuque](https://github.com/IDubuque)! - The `@thirdweb-dev/payments` package is a continuation of the `@paperxyz/js-client-sdk`, aligning with the new branding and expanded capabilities under thirdweb. It inherits the core functionality of Paper's developer-first NFT checkout solution.

  ### Changed

  - Rebranded package from `@paperxyz/js-client-sdk` to `@thirdweb-dev/payments`. Users of the old package should migrate to this new package name.
  - Changed PaperSdkError typename to PaymentsSdkError
