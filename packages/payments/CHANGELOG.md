It inherits the core functionality of Paper's developer-first NFT checkout solution.

  ### Changed

  - Rebranded package from `@paperxyz/js-client-sdk` to `@thirdweb-dev/payments`. Users of the old package should migrate to this new package name.
  - Changed PaperSdkError typename to PaymentsSdkError
