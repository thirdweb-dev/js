# Nebula OpenAPI TypeScript wrapper

This package is a thin OpenAPI wrapper for Nebula, our AI agent service.

## Configuration

```ts
import { configure } from "@thirdweb-dev/nebula";

// call this once at the startup of your application
configure({
  secretKey: "<PROJECT_SECRET_KEY>",
});
```

You can also configure the client with a Thirdweb client instance:

```ts
import { configureWithClient } from "@thirdweb-dev/nebula";
import { twClient } from "./thirdwebClient";

// call this once at the startup of your application
configureWithClient(twClient);
```

## Example Usage

```ts
import { getModels } from "@thirdweb-dev/nebula";

const models = await getModels();
```

You can also use this package on a client application (eg. NextJS) by retrieving the Nebula API client first.

```ts
import { getNebulaClient, getAgents } from "@thirdweb-dev/nebula";

// retrieve the Nebula auth token
const nebulaClient = getNebulaClient(authToken);

// pass the client inside the methods
const agentsResult = await getAgents({ client: nebulaClient });
```

This package was autogenerated from the [Nebula openAPI spec](https://nebula-api.thirdweb.com/docs) using [@hey-api/openapi-ts](https://github.com/hey-api/openapi-ts)
