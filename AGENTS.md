ðŸ¤– Codex Agent Guidelines for thirdweb-dev/js

Welcome, AI copilots! This guide captures the coding standards, architectural decisions, and workflow conventions that every automated agent (and human contributor!) must follow. Unless a rule explicitly targets a subâ€‘project, it applies repoâ€‘wide.

â¸»

1.Â GitHub WorkflowÂ & Etiquette

- Pullâ€‘request titles must start with the affected workspace in brackets (e.g. [SDK], [Dashboard], [Portal], [Playground]).
- Begin the PR description with a oneâ€‘sentence summary, then add a checklist of changes and reference issues with Fixes #123.
- Keep commits small and topical â€“ one logical change per commit.
- Branch names should follow area/brief-topic (e.g. sdk/fix-gas-estimate). Avoid personal names.
- Request at least one core maintainer review. Do not selfâ€‘merge unless you are the sole owner of that package.
- All CI checks (typeâ€‘check, Biome, tests) must pass before merging.

2.Â Formatting & Linting

- Biome governs formatting and linting; its rules live in biome.json.
- Run pnpm biome check --apply before committing.
- Avoid editorâ€‘specific configs; rely on the shared settings.

â¸»

3.Â TypeScript Style Guide

- Write idiomatic TypeScript: explicit function declarations and return types.
- Limit each file to one stateless, singleâ€‘responsibility function for clarity and testability.
- Reâ€‘use shared types from @/types or local types.ts barrels.
- Prefer type aliases over interface except for nominal shapes.
- Avoid any and unknown unless unavoidable; narrow generics whenever possible.
- Choose composition over inheritance; leverage utility types (Partial, Pick, etc.).

â¸»

4.Â Testing Strategy

- Coâ€‘locate tests: foo.ts â†” foo.test.ts.
- Use real function invocations with stub data; avoid brittle mocks.
- For network interactions, use Mock Service Worker (MSW) to intercept fetch/HTTP calls, mocking only scenarios that are hard to reproduce.
- Keep tests deterministic and sideâ€‘effect free; Jest is preâ€‘configured.

5.1Â Public API Surface

- Export everything via the exports/ directory, grouped by feature.
- Every public symbol must have comprehensive TSDoc:
- Include at least one @example block that compiles.
- Tag with one custom annotation (@beta, @internal, @experimental, etc.).
- Comment only ambiguous logic; avoid restating TypeScript in prose.

  5.2Â Performance

- Lazyâ€‘load heavy dependencies inside async paths to keep the initial bundle lean:

`const { jsPDF } = await import("jspdf");`

6.Â apps/dashboard & apps/playground

6.1Â CoreÂ UI Toolkit

- Import primitives from @/components/ui/\_ (e.g. Button, Input, Select, Tabs, Card, Sidebar, Badge, Separator).
- Use NavLink for internal navigation so active states are handled automatically.
- Group featureâ€‘specific components under feature/components/\_ and expose a barrel index.ts when necessary.

  6.2Â Styling Conventions

- Tailwind CSS is the styling system â€“ no inline styles or CSS modules.
- Merge class names with cn() from @/lib/utils to keep conditional logic readable.
- Stick to design tokens: backgrounds (bg-card), borders (border-border), muted text (text-muted-foreground), etc.
- Expose a className prop on the root element of every component for overrides.

  6.3Â Component Patterns

- Server Components (run on the Node edge):
  -- Read cookies/headers with next/headers.
  -- Access serverâ€‘only environment variables or secrets.
  -- Perform heavy data fetching that should not ship to the client.
  -- Implement redirect logic with redirect() from next/navigation.
  -- Start files with import "server-only"; to prevent client bundling.
- Client Components (run in the browser):
  -- Begin files with 'use client'; before imports.
  -- Handle interactive UI relying on React hooks (useState, useEffect, React Query, wallet hooks).
  -- Access browser APIs (localStorage, window, IntersectionObserver, etc.).
  -- Support fast transitions where data is prefetched on the client.

  6.4Â DataÂ Fetching Guidelines

- Server Side
  -- Always call getAuthToken() to retrieve the JWT from cookies.
  -- Inject the token as an Authorization: Bearer header â€“ never embed it in the URL.
  -- Return typed results (Project[], User[], â€¦) â€“ avoid any.
- Client Side
  -- Wrap calls in React Query (@tanstack/react-query).
  -- Use descriptive, stable queryKeys for cache hits.
  -- Configure staleTime / cacheTime based on freshness requirements (default â‰¥â€¯60â€¯s).
  -- Keep tokens secret by calling internal API routes or server actions.

7.Â Performance & Bundle Size

- Track bundle budgets via package.json#size-limit.
- Lazyâ€‘import optional features; avoid topâ€‘level sideâ€‘effects.
- Deâ€‘duplicate dependencies across packages through pnpm workspace hoisting.

â¸»

8.Â Documentation & Developer Experience

- Each change in packages/\* should contain a changeset for the appropriate package, with the appropriate version bump

  - patch for changes that don't impact the public API
  - minor for any new/modified public API

- Surface breaking changes prominently in PR descriptions.
- For new UI components, add Storybook stories (\*.stories.tsx) alongside the code.
